The network design uses a recursive decomposition approach and is based on the binary radix sorting concept. All functional components of the network are reverse banyan networks. Specifically, the new multicast network is recursively constructed by cascading a binary splitting network and two half-size multicast networks. The binary splitting network, in turn, consists of two recursively constructed reverse banyan networks. The first reverse banyan network serves as a scatter network and the second reverse banyan network serves as a quasisorting network. The advantage of this approach is to provide a way to self-route multicast assignments through the network and a possibility to reuse part of network to reduce the network cost. The new multicast network we design is compared favorably with the previously proposed multicast networks. It uses O(n log/sup 2/ n) logic gates, and has O(log/sup 2/ n) depth and O(log/sup 2/ n) routing time where the unit of time is a gate delay. By reusing part of the network, the feedback implementation of the network can further reduce the network cost to O(n log n)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.819951"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819951"","""",""Routing";Delay effects;Switches;Sorting;Costs;Logic gates;Hardware;Scattering;Feedback;"Distributed databases"","""",""23"",""1"",""15"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Switched irregular networks are truly incrementally scalable and have potential to be reconfigured to adapt to the dynamics of network traffic conditions. Due to the arbitrary topologies of networks, it is critical to develop an efficient deadlock-free routing algorithm. A novel deadlock-free adaptive routing algorithm called adaptive-trail routing is proposed to allow irregular interconnection of cut-through switches. The adaptive routing algorithm is based on two unidirectional adaptive trails constructed from two opposite unidirectional Eulerian trails. Some heuristics are suggested in terms of the selection of Eulerian trails, the avoidance of long routing paths, and the degree of adaptivity.

In this paper, we consider the routing between arbitrary network inputs and outputs in the Clos network in the presence of interstage link faults. In particular, we present an analytical model for the routing blocking probability of the Clos network which incorporates the probability of interstage link failure to allow for a more realistic and useful determination of the approximation of blocking probability. We also conduct extensive simulations to validate the model. Our analytical and simulation results demonstrate that for a relatively small interstage link failure probability, the blocking behavior of the Clos network is similar to that of a fault-free network, and indicate that the Clos network has a good fault-tolerant capability.

The deadlock issues in tree-based multicasting in MINs are analyzed first to examine the main causes of deadlocks. An ATBM framework is developed in which deadlocks are prevented by serializing the initiations of tree operations that have a potential to create deadlocks. These tree operations are identified through a grouping algorithm. The ATBM approach is not only simple to implement but also provides good communication performance using minimal overheads in terms of additional hardware requirements and synchronization delay. Using the ATBM framework, algorithms are developed for both unidirectional and bidirectional multistage interconnection networks. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated through simulation experiments.

Chameleon provides dependability through the use of special ARMORs-Adaptive. Reconfigurable, and Mobile Objects for Reliability-that control all operations in the Chameleon environment. Three broad classes of ARMORs are defined: 1) Managers oversee other ARMORs and recover from failures in their subordinates. 2) Daemons provide communication gateways to the ARMORs at the host node. They also make available a host's resources to the Chameleon environment. 3) Common ARMORs implement specific techniques for providing application-required dependability. Employing ARMORs, Chameleon makes available different fault-tolerant configurations and maintains run-time adaptation to changes in the availability requirements of an application. Flexible ARMOR architecture allows their composition to be reconfigured at run-time, i.e., the ARMORs may dynamically adapt to changing application requirements. In this paper, we describe ARMOR architecture, including ARMOR class hierarchy, basic building blocks, ARMOR composition, and use of ARMOR factories. We present how ARMORs can be reconfigured and reengineered and demonstrate how the architecture serves our objective of providing an adaptive software infrastructure. To our knowledge, Chameleon is one of the few real implementations which enables multiple fault tolerance strategies to exist in the same environment and supports fault-tolerant execution of substantially off-the-shelf applications via a software infrastructure only. Chameleon provides fault tolerance from the application's point of view as well as from the software infrastructure's point of view. To demonstrate the Chameleon capabilities, we have implemented a prototype infrastructure which provides set of ARMORs to initialize the environment and to support the dual and TMR application execution modes. Through this testbed environment, we measure the execution overhead and recovery times from failures in the user application, the Chameleon ARMORs, the hardware, and the operating system."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.774907"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=774907"","""",""Fault tolerance";Application software;Availability;Runtime;Computer architecture;Telecommunication network reliability;Communication system control;Mobile communication;Production facilities;"Software prototyping"","""",""114"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

The hypernet network owns two structural advantages: expansibility and equal degree. In addition, it was shown to be efficient in both communication and computation. Since the number of nodes contained in the hypernet network increases very rapidly with expansion level, we emphasize the hypernet network of two levels (denoted by HN(d, 2)) with a practical view. Recently, combinatorial properties such as container (i.e., node-disjoint paths), wide diameter, and fault diameter have received much attention due to their increasing importance and applications in networks. The following results are obtained for HN(d, 2): (1) best containers with width d-1, (2) containers with (maximum) width d, (3) the (d-1)-wide diameter, (4) the d-wide diameter, (5) the (d-2)-fault diameter, and (6) the (d-1)-fault diameter. More specifically, between every two nodes of HN(d, 2), d (or d-1) packets can be transmitted simultaneously with at most D+2 (or D+1) parallel steps, where D=2d+1 is the diameter of HN(d, 2). Besides, the diameter of HN(d, 2) will increase by at most two (or one), if there are at most d-1 (or d-2) node faults.

The algorithm uses a branch-and-bound (B & B) technique to search for a task schedule by minimizing maximum task lateness (defined as the difference between task completion time and task deadline), and exploits the interplay between task and message scheduling to improve the quality of solution.

Conditional branches are the primary impediment to increasing the fetch bandwidth because they can potentially alter the flow of control and are very frequent. To overcome this problem, these processors need to predict the outcome of multiple branches in a cycle. This paper investigates two control flow prediction schemes that predict the effective outcome of multiple branches with the help of a single prediction. Instead of considering branches as the basic units of prediction, these schemes consider subgraphs of the control flow graph of the executed program as the basic units of prediction and predict the target of an entire subgraph at a time, thereby allowing the superscalar fetch mechanism to go past multiple branches in a cycle. The first control flow prediction scheme investigated considers sequential block-like subgraphs and the second scheme considers tree-like subgraphs to make the control flow predictions. Both schemes do a 1-out-of-4 prediction as opposed to the 1-out-of-2 prediction done by branch-level prediction schemes. These two schemes are evaluated using a MIPS ISA-based 12-way superscalar microarchitecture. An improvement in effective fetch size of approximately 25 percent and 50 percent, respectively, is observed over identical microprocessors that use branch-level prediction. No appreciable difference in the prediction accuracy was observed, although the control flow prediction schemes predicted 1-out-of-4, outcomes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.762815"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=762815"","""",""Hardware";Instruction sets;Impedance;Microprocessors;Accuracy;Parallel processing;Bandwidth;Flow graphs;Microarchitecture;"Decoding"","""",""2"","""",""19"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such marking is conveniently carried out by modifying the data item's control tag. It is the combination of the above features that allows us to derive the first single-cycle priority queue that operates in fully pipelined mode, with no broadcasting of data values or control signals.

Conservative flow control mechanisms, such as pipelined circuit switching (PCS), ensure the existence of a path to the destination prior to message transmission, achieving reliable transmission at the expense of performance. This paper proposes a general class of flow control mechanisms that can be dynamically configured to trade-off reliability and performance. Routing protocols can then be designed such that, in the vicinity of faults, protocols use a more conservative flow control mechanism, while the majority of messages that traverse fault-free portions of the network utilize a WS like flow control to maximize performance. We refer to such protocols as two-phase protocols. This ability provides new avenues for optimizing message passing performance in the presence of faults.

In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for array redistribution from cyclic(x) on P processors to cyclic(Kx) on Q processors. The algorithm reduces the overall time for communication by considering the data transfer, communication schedule, and index computation costs. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized circulant matrix formalism. Our algorithm generates a schedule that minimizes the number of communication steps and eliminates node contention in each communication step. The network bandwidth is fully utilized by ensuring that equal-sized messages are transferred in each communication step. Furthermore, the time to compute the schedule and the index sets is significantly smaller. It takes O(max(P, Q)) time and is less than 1 percent of the data transfer time. In comparison, the schedule computation time using the state-of-the-art scheme (which is based on the bipartite matching scheme) is 10 to 50 percent of the data transfer time for similar problem sizes.

To broadcast a message, the scheme works in three phases. First, a number of data-distributing networks (DDNs), which can work independently, are constructed. Then the message is evenly divided into submessages, each being sent to a representative node in one DDN. Second, the submessages are broadcast on the DDNs concurrently. Finally, a number of data-collecting networks (DCNs), which can work independently too, are constructed. Then, concurrently on each DCN, the submessages are collected and combined into the original message. Our approach, especially designed for wormhole-routed networks, is conceptually similar but fundamentally very different from the traditional approach of using multiple edge-disjoint spanning trees in parallel for broadcasting in store-and-forward networks. One interesting issue is on the definition of independent DDNs and DCNs, in the sense of wormhole routing. We show how to apply this approach to tori, meshes, and hypercubes. Thorough analyses and comparisons based on different system parameters and configurations are conducted.

Algorithms for tolerating faulty nodes and links in hypercubes are presented. The algorithms are based on using general spanning trees (GST), complete unbalanced spanning trees (CUST), and balanced spanning trees (BST) for reconfiguring the hypercube to avoid faulty nodes and links. The algorithms contain two phases: the first phase involves the construction of the spanning tree and the second one is for reconfiguring the hypercube should a faulty node be detected. The reconfiguration process consists of two basic steps. First, the faulty node is disconnected from the spanning tree. Then, a new spanning tree is constructed by reconnecting the children of the faulty node to the spanning tree. One hundred percent single fault correction (avoidance) and almost 100 percent fault correction (avoidance) of double and triple faults are achieved by the proposed algorithms for hypercubes having a dimension of n/spl ges/6. Simulation results for the algorithm under more than three faults also are presented. For any k faulty nodes (1/spl les/k/spl les/2/sup n/-1), the reconfiguration algorithm may be applied k times to avoid these k faulty nodes as long as no combination of any two of the faults results in a blocking situation. The proposed reconfiguration algorithms tolerate all possible single-link faults.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm called FASTEST (Fast Assignment and Scheduling of Tasks using an Efficient Search Technique) that has O(e) time complexity, where e is the number of edges in the task graph. The algorithm first generates an initial solution in a short time and then refines it by using a simple but robust random neighborhood search. We have also parallelized the search to further lower the time complexity. We are using the algorithm in a prototype automatic parallelization and scheduling tool which compiles sequential code and generates parallel code optimized with judicious scheduling. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with several application programs and outperforms a number of previous algorithms by generating parallelized code with shorter execution times, while taking dramatically shorter scheduling times.

In this paper, fault tolerance is implemented by using a novel duplication technique where each task scheduled on a processor has either an active backup copy or a passive backup copy scheduled on a different processor. An active copy is always executed, while a passive copy is executed only in the case of a failure. First, the paper considers the ability of the widely-used rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm to meet the deadlines of periodic tasks in the presence of a processor failure. In particular, the completion time test is extended so as to check the schedulability on a single processor of a task set including backup copies. Then, the paper extends the well-known rate-monotonic first-fit assignment algorithm, where all the task copies, included the backup copies, are considered by rate-monotonic priority order and assigned to the first processor in which they fit. The proposed algorithm determines which tasks must use the active duplication and which can use the passive duplication. Passive duplication is preferred whenever possible, so as to overbook each processor with many passive copies whose primary copies are assigned to different processors. Moreover, the space allocated to active copies is reclaimed as soon as a failure is detected. Passive copy overbooking and active copy deallocation allow many passive copies to be scheduled sharing the same time intervals on the same processor, thus reducing the total number of processors needed. Simulation studies reveal a remarkable saving of processors with respect to those needed by the usual active duplication approach in which the schedule of the non-fault-tolerant case is duplicated on two sets of processors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.798317"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=798317"","""",""Fault tolerant systems";Processor scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Multiprocessing systems;Fault tolerance;Testing;Dynamic scheduling;Computer industry;"Distributed computing"","""",""65"",""2"",""14"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

The correctness of the algorithm is proven and a methodology is developed to integrate range comparison into restructuring compilations for data-parallel programming. A preliminary prototype of the methodology is implemented and tested under Vienna Fortran Compilation System. Experimental results demonstrate that range comparison is feasible and effective.

In the case of memory references via pointers, it is often difficult to determine if the memory reference is guaranteed to be local and, thus, can be handled via an inexpensive memory operation. Determining which memory accesses are local can be done by the programmer, the compiler, or a combination of both. The overall goal is to minimize the work required by the programmer and have the compiler automate the process as much as possible. This paper reports on compiler techniques for determining when indirect memory references are local. The locality analysis has been implemented for a parallel dialect of C called EARTH-C, and it uses an algorithm inspired by type inference algorithms for fast points-to analysis. The algorithm statically estimates when an indirect reference via a pointer can be safely assumed to be a local access. The locality inference algorithm is also used to guide the automatic specialization of functions in order to take advantage of locality specific to particular calling contexts. In addition to these purely static techniques, we also suggest fine-grain and coarse-grain dynamic techniques. In this case, dynamic locality checks are inserted into the program and specialized code for the local case is inserted. In the fine-grain case, the checks are put around single memory references, while in the coarse-grain case the checks are put around larger program segments. The static locality analysis and automatic specialization has been implemented in the EARTH-C compiler, which produces low-level threaded code for the EARTH multithreaded architecture. Experimental results are presented for a set of benchmarks that operate on irregular, dynamically allocated data structures. Overall, the techniques give moderate to significant speedups, with the combination of static and dynamic techniques giving the best performance overall."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.752778"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=752778"","""",""Programming profession";Program processors;Inference algorithms;Parallel architectures;Earth;Data structures;Algorithm design and analysis;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;"Computer languages"","""",""6"","""",""12"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This approach works based on a coterie, a special set of node groups where any pair of the node groups shares at least one common node. Each node group in a coterie is called a quorum. Mutual exclusion is ensured by imposing that a node gets consensus from all nodes in at least one of the quorums before it enters a critical section. In a quorum-based mutual exclusion scheme, the delay for reaching consensus depends critically on the coterie adopted and, thus, it is important to find a coterie with small delay. Fu (1997) introduced two related measures called max-delay and mean-delay. The former measure represents the largest delay among all nodes, while the latter is the arithmetic mean of the delays. She proposed polynomial-time algorithms for finding max-delay and mean-delay optimal coteries when the network topology is a tree or a ring. In this paper, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm for finding max-delay optimal coteries and, then, modify the algorithm so as to reduce the mean-delay of generated coteries.

The model is illustrated with several common routing schemes (deterministic, as well as adaptive), and the associated deadlock-freedom properties are analyzed. Using this model, a set of new algorithms for popular collective communication operations, broadcast and multicast, are proposed and evaluated. It is shown that the proposed algorithms can considerably reduce the latency of these operations compared to the Umesh (unicast-based multicast) and the Hamiltonian path-based schemes. A very interesting result that is presented shows that a multicast can be implemented with reduced or near-constant latency as the number of processors participating in the multicast increases beyond a certain number.

The existing multicast algorithms in the literature deliver poor performance under multiple multicast because these algorithms have been designed with only single multicast in mind. The new algorithms introduced in this paper do not use any global knowledge about the respective destination sets of the concurrent multicasts. Instead, only local information and a source-specific partitioning approach are used. For systems supporting unicast message-passing, a new SPUmesh (Source-Partitioned Umesh) algorithm is proposed and is shown to be superior than the conventional Umesh algorithm for multiple multicast. Two different algorithms, SQHL (Source-Quadrant Hierarchical Leader) and SCHL (Source-Centered Hierarchical Leader), are proposed for systems with multidestination message-passing and shown to be superior than the HL scheme. All of these algorithms perform 1) 5-10 times faster than the existing algorithms under multiple multicast and 2) as fast as existing algorithms under single multicast. Furthermore, the SCHL scheme demonstrates that the latency of multiple multicast can, in fact, be reduced as the degree of multicast increases beyond a certain number.

Consequently, these heuristics do not scale well and cannot handle problems of moderate sizes. A natural approach to reducing complexity, while aiming for a similar or potentially better solution, is to parallelize the scheduling algorithm. This can be done by partitioning the task graphs and concurrently generating partial schedules for the partitioned parts, which are then concatenated to obtain the final schedule. The problem, however, is nontrivial as there exists dependencies among the nodes of a task graph which must be preserved for generating a valid schedule. Moreover, the time clock for scheduling is global for all the processors (that are executing the parallel scheduling algorithm), making the inherent parallelism invisible. In this paper, we introduce a parallel algorithm that is guided by a systematic partitioning of the task graph to perform scheduling using multiple processors. The algorithm schedules both the tasks and messages, and is suitable for graphs with arbitrary computation and communication costs, and is applicable to systems with arbitrary network topologies using homogeneous or heterogeneous processors. We have implemented the algorithm on the Intel Paragon and compared it with three closely related algorithms. The experimental results indicate that our algorithm yields higher quality solutions while using an order of magnitude smaller scheduling times. The algorithm also exhibits an interesting trade-off between the solution quality and speedup while scaling well with the problem size."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.762819"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=762819"","""",""Processor scheduling";Scheduling algorithm;Partitioning algorithms;Concatenated codes;Clocks;Parallel processing;Parallel algorithms;Computer networks;Computational efficiency;"Network topology"","""",""42"",""2"",""29"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This reconfiguration may result in processor overload where it is no longer possible to meet the deadlines of all tasks. In this paper, we discuss an overload management technique which discards selected task instances in such a way that the performance of the control loops in the system remain satisfactory even after a failure.

For instance, short control messages may be sent with the lowest overhead on one type of network, such as Ethernet, while bulk data transfers may be better suited to a different type of network, such as Fibre Channel or HIPPI. This work investigates how to exploit multiple heterogeneous communication networks that interconnect the same set of processing nodes using a set of techniques we call performance-based path determination (PBPD). The performance-based path selection (PBPS) technique selects the best (lowest latency) network among several for each individual message to reduce the communication overhead of parallel programs. The performance-based path aggregation (PBPA) technique, on the other hand, aggregates multiple networks into a single virtual network to increase the available bandwidth. We test the PBPD techniques on a cluster of SGI multiprocessors interconnected with Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and HiPPI networks using a custom communication library built on top of the TCP/IP protocol layers. We find that PBPS can reduce communication overhead in applications compared to using either network alone, while aggregating networks into a single virtual network can reduce communication latency for bandwidth-limited applications.

Virtually all proposed chordal ring networks are node-symmetric, i.e., all nodes have the same in/out degree and interconnection pattern. Unfortunately, such regular chordal rings are not scalable. In this paper, periodically regular chordal (PRC) ring networks are proposed as a compromise for combining low node degree with small diameter. By varying the PRC ring parameters, one can obtain architectures with significantly different characteristics (e.g., from linear to logarithmic diameter), while maintaining an elegant framework for computation and communication. In particular, a very simple and efficient routing algorithm works for the entire spectrum of PRC rings thus obtained. This flexibility has important implications for key system attributes such as architectural satiability, software portability, and fault tolerance. Our discussion is centered on unidirectional PRC rings with in/out-degree of 2.

Shared-bus shared-memory multiprocessor can be used to speed-up the execution of such workload. In this environment, the scheduler takes care of the load balancing by allocating a ready process on the first available processor, thus producing process migration. Process migration and the persistence of private data into different caches produce an undesired sharing, named passive sharing. The copies due to passive sharing produce useless coherence traffic on the bus and coping with such a problem may represent a challenging design problem for these machines. Many protocols use smart solutions to limit the overhead to maintain coherence among shared copies. None of these studies treats passive-sharing directly, although some indirect effect is present while dealing with the other kinds of sharing. Affinity scheduling can alleviate this problem, but this technique does not adapt to all load conditions, especially when the effects of migration are massive. We present a simple coherence protocol that eliminates passive sharing using information from the compiler that is normally available in operating system kernels. We evaluate the performance of this protocol and compare it against other solutions proposed in the literature by means of enhanced trace-driven simulation. We evaluate the complexity in terms of the number of protocol states, additional bus lines, and required software support. Our protocol further limits the coherence-maintaining overhead by using information about access patterns to shared data exhibited in parallel applications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.780868"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=780868"","""",""Access protocols";Operating systems;Scalability;Workstations;Processor scheduling;Load management;Kernel;Application software;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;"Pattern analysis"","""",""11"",""13"",""78"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In asynchronous checkpointing, processes take checkpoints without any coordination with others. Asynchronous checkpointing provides maximum autonomy for processes to take checkpoints";" however, some of the checkpoints taken may not lie on any consistent global checkpoint, thus making the checkpointing efforts useless. Asynchronous checkpointing algorithms in the literature can reduce the number of useless checkpoints by making processes take communication induced checkpoints besides asynchronous checkpoints.

Eliminating redundant synchronizations in DOACROSS loops allows more efficient execution of such loops.

A sequence of three ASCI Teraflops MPPs has appeared before the new millenium. This paper evaluates six MPP systems through STAP benchmark experiments. The STAP is a radar signal processing benchmark which exploits regularly structured SPMD data parallelism. We reveal the resource scaling effects on MPP performance along orthogonal dimensions of machine size, processor speed, memory capacity messaging latency, and network bandwidth. We show how to achieve balanced resources scaling against enlarged workload (problem size). Among three commercial MPPs, the IBM SP2 shows the highest speed and efficiency, attributed to its well-designed network with middleware support for single system image. The Cray T3D demonstrates a high network bandwidth with a good NUMA memory hierarchy. The Intel Paragon trails far behind due to slow processors used and excessive latency experienced in passing messages. Our analysis projects the lowest STAP speed on the ASCI Red, compared with the projected speed of two ASCI Blue machines. This is attributed to slow processors used in ASCI Red and the mismatch between its hardware and software. The Blue Pacific shows the highest potential to deliver scalable performance up to thousands of nodes. The Blue Mountain is designed to have the highest network bandwidth. Our results suggest a limit on the scalability of the distributed shared-memory (DSM) architecture adopted in Blue Mountain. The scaling model offers a quantitative method to match resource scaling with problem scaling to yield a truly scalable performance. The model helps MPP designers optimize the processors, memory, network, and I/O subsystems of an MPP. For MPP users, the scaling results can be applied to partition a large workload for SPMD execution or to minimize the software overhead in collective communication or remote memory update operations.

Maximizing performance has been the conventional objective in the allocation of tasks for such systems. Inherently, distributed systems are more complex than centralized systems. The added complexity could increase the potential for system failures. Some work has been done in the past in allocating tasks to distributed systems, considering reliability as the objective function to be maximized. Reliability is defined to be the probability that none of the system components falls while processing. This, however, does not give any guarantees as to the behavior of the system when a failure occurs. A failure, not detected immediately, could lead to a catastrophe. Such systems are unsafe. In this paper, we describe a method to determine an allocation that introduces safety into a heterogeneous distributed system and at the same time attempts to maximize its reliability. First, we devise a new heuristic, based on the concept of clustering, to allocate tasks for maximizing reliability. We show that for task graphs with precedence constraints, our heuristic performs better than previously proposed heuristics. Next, by applying the concept of task-based fault tolerance, which we have previously proposed, we add extra assertion tasks to the system to make it safe. We present a new heuristic that does this in such a way that the decrease in reliability for the added safety is minimized. For the purpose of allocating the extra tasks, this heuristic performs as well as previously known methods and runs an order of magnitude faster.

We first introduce tensor bases to capture the semantics of block-cyclic data distributions of out-of-core data and also data access patterns to out-of-core data. We then present program generation techniques for tensor products and matrix transposition. We accurately represent the number of parallel I/O operations required for the synthesized programs for tensor products and matrix transposition as a function of tensor bases and data distributions.

This requires the use of appropriate prefetching and buffer management algorithms that ensure the most useful blocks are accessed and retained in the buffer. In this paper, we answer several fundamental questions on prefetching and buffer management for distributed-buffer parallel I/O systems. First, we derive and prove the optimality of an algorithm, P-min, that minimizes the number of parallel I/Os. Second, we analyze P-con, an algorithm that always matches its replacement decisions with those of the well-known demand-paged MIN algorithm. We show that P-con can become fully sequential in the worst case. Third, we investigate the behavior of on-line algorithms for multiple-disk prefetching and buffer management.

In our analysis, we consider the case of a simulation model with homogeneous logical processes, where """"homogeneous"""" means they have the same average event routine time and the same state saving cost.

For the former case, remapping can be performed by some fast mapping algorithms. For the latter case, a load-balancing algorithm can be applied to balance the computational load of each processor. In this paper, three tree-based parallel load-balancing methods, the MCSTLB method, the BTLB method, and the CBTLB method, were proposed to deal with the load imbalance problems of solution-adaptive finite element application programs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we have implemented those methods along with three mapping methods, the AE/ORB method, the AE/MC method, and the MLkP method, on an SP2 parallel machine. Three criteria, the execution time of mapping/load-balancing methods, the execution time of a solution-adaptive finite element application program under different mapping/load-balancing methods, and the speedups achieved by mapping/load-balancing methods for a solution-adaptive finite element application program, are used for the performance evaluation. The experimental results show that 1) if the initial mapping is performed by a mapping method and the same mapping method and load-balancing methods were used in each refinement to balance the load of processors, the execution time of an application program under a load-balancing method is always shorter than that of the mapping method, and 2) the execution time of an application program under the CBTLB method is shorter than that of the BTLB method and the MCSTLB method."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.762816"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=762816"","""",""Tree graphs";Finite element methods;Load management;Distributed computing;Partitioning algorithms;Computer Society;Application software;Parallel machines;"Equations"","""",""10"",""1"",""39"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We propose three algorithms which find a nonfaulty routing path between s and t for unicast in the hypercube with a large number of faulty nodes. Given the n-dimensional hypercube H/sub n/ and a set F of faulty nodes, node u/spl epsiv/ H/sub n/ is called k-safe if u has at least k nonfaulty neighbors. The H/sub n/ is called k-safe if every node of H/sub n/ is k-safe. It has been known that for 0/spl les/k/spl les/n/2, a k-safe H/sub n/ is connected if |F|/spl les/2/sup k/(n-k)-1. Our first algorithm finds a nonfaulty path of length at most d(s,t)+4 in O(n) time for unicast between 1-safe s and t in the H/sub n/ with |F|/spl les/2n-3, where d(s,t) is the distance between s and t. The second algorithm finds a nonfaulty path of length at most d(s,t)+6 in O(n) time for unicast in the 2-safe H/sub n/ with |F|/spl les/4n-9. The third algorithm finds a nonfaulty path of length at most d(s,t)+O(k/sup 2/) in time O(|F|+n) for unicast in the k-safe H/sub n/ with |F|/spl les/2/sup k/(n-k)-1 (0/spl les/k/spl les/n/2). The time complexities of the algorithms are optimal. We show that in the worst case, the length of the nonfaulty path between s and t in a k-safe H/sub n/ with |F|/spl les/2/sup k/(n-k)-1 is at least d(s,t)+2(k+1) for 0/spl les/k/spl les/n/2.

In contrast, our constructions are designed to largely shield programmers from this fragmentation. Furthermore, for many objects, our constructions result in lower copying overhead than previous ones.

The vehicle for this demonstration is a suite of algorithms that endow an N-processor bit-serial processor array A with a """"meta-instruction"""" GAUGE k, which (logically) reconfigures A into an N/k-processor virtual machine B/sub k/ that has: 1) a datapath and memory bus whose emulated width is k bits, as opposed to A's 1-bit width and 2) an instruction set that operates on k-bit words, in contrast to A's instruction set, which operates on 1-bit words. In order to stress the strength of the approach, we show (via pseudocode) how our emulation techniques can be implemented efficiently even if A operates in strict SIMD mode, with only single-bit masking capabilities and with no indexed memory accesses. We describe at an algorithmic level how to implement our technique-including datapath conversion (""""corner-turning"""") and the creation of the word-parallel instruction sets-on arrays of any regular network topology. We instantiate our technique in detail for arrays based on topologies with quite disparate characteristics: the hypercube, the de Bruijn network, and a genre of mesh with reconfigurable buses.

This paper addresses a self-tested self-synchronization (STSS) method for vector transfer between PEs. A test signal is added to remove the data read failure. The advantages of this method are: very high data throughput, less power consumption in clock distribution, no constraints on clock skew and system scale, easy in design, less latency. A failure zone concept is used to characterize the behavior of storage elements. By using a jitter injected test signal, a robust vector transfer between PEs with arbitrary clock phases is achieved and the headache problem of the global synchronization is avoided."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.790596"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=790596"","""",""Built-in self-test";Clocks;Testing;Large-scale systems;Throughput;Energy consumption;Delay;Jitter;Robustness;"Synchronization"","""",""2"",""1"",""27"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper presents work-efficient (or cost-optimal) routing algorithms to determine the switch settings for realizing permutations on rearrangeable symmetrical networks such as Benes and the reduced /spl Omega//sub N//spl Omega//sub N//sup -1/. These networks have 2n-1 stages with N=2/sup n/ inputs/outputs, each stage consisting of N/2 crossbar switches of size (2/spl times/2). Previously known parallel routing algorithms for a rearrangeable network with N inputs determine the states of all switches recursively in O(n) iterations using N processors. Each iteration determines the switch settings of at most two stages of the network and requires at least O(n) time on a computer of N processors, regardless of the type of its interconnection network. Hence, the work of any previously known parallel routing algorithm equals at least O(Nn/sup 2/) for setting up all the switches of a rearrangeable network. The new routing algorithms run on a computer of p processors, 1/spl les/p/spl les/N/n, and perform work O(Nn). Moreover, because the range of p is large, the new routing algorithms do not have to be changed in case some processors become faulty."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.780867"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=780867"","""",""Routing";Switches;Parallel algorithms;Phase change random access memory;Intelligent networks;Concurrent computing;Computer networks;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Symmetric matrices;"Algorithm design and analysis"","""",""15"",""2"",""14"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
