Additionally, the work function is assumed herein to be convex in the processing time.

The incredible growth of viewers, dynamics of participants, and high video quality of service (QoS) requirement pose scalability, availability, and low-latency challenges to peer-to-peer (P2P) live video streaming systems. Tree-based systems have low-delay but are vulnerable to churn, while mesh-based systems are churn-resilient but suffer from high delay and overhead. Also, both structures cannot make full utilization of the bandwidth in the system. To tackle the challenges, we propose a DHT-aided chunk-driven overlay (DCO). It introduces a scalable DHT ring structure into a mesh-based overlay to efficiently manage video stream sharing. DCO includes a two-layer hierarchical DHT-based infrastructure, a chunk sharing algorithm, and a video provider selection algorithm. It selects stable nodes to form a scalable DHT-based infrastructure. The nodes in the DHT serve as distributed matchmakers between video providers and requesters. To motivate stable nodes to serve as the DHT nodes, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on the game theory. Aided by DHT, DCO guarantees stream chunk availability and assigns to a chunk requester a provider among all available providers in the system so that stream chunks are transmitted along a dynamic tree with top-down decreasing node bandwidth. In this way, DCO takes full advantage of available bandwidth in the system and, at the same time, provides high scalability and low latency. Experimental results show the superior performance of DCO compared with mesh-based and tree-based systems, and the effectiveness of the incentive mechanism and provider selection algorithm."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.302"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6336745"",""DHT";P2P live streaming;"chunk-driven"",""Peer to peer computing";Bandwidth;Streaming media;Indexes;Servers;Nickel;"Availability"","""",""18"","""",""51"",""IEEE"",""22 Oct 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most previous consistency maintenance methods depend on either message spreading or structure-based pushing. Message spreading generates high overhead due to a large amount of messages"; structure-based pushing methods reduce this overhead. However, both approaches cannot guarantee that every replica node receives an update in churn, because replica nodes passively wait for updates. As opposed to push-based methods that are not effective in high-churn and low-resource P2P systems, polling is churn resilient and generates low overhead. However, it is faced with a number of challenges: 1) ensuring a limited inconsistency; 2) realizing polling in a distributed manner; 3) considering physical proximity in polling;" and 4) leveraging polling to further reduce polling overhead. To handle these challenges, this paper introduces a poll-based distributed file consistency maintenance method called geographically aware wave (GeWave). GeWave further reduces update overhead, enhances the fidelity of file consistency, and takes proximity into account. Using adaptive polling in a dynamic structure, GeWave avoids redundant file updates and ensures that every node receives an update in a limited time period even in churn. Furthermore, it propagates updates between geographically close nodes in a distributed manner. Extensive experimental results from the PlanetLab real-world testbed demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of GeWave in comparison with other representative consistency maintenance schemes. It dramatically reduces the overhead and yields significant improvements on effectiveness, scalability, and churn resilience of previous file consistency maintenance methods."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.317"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378362"",""Consistency maintenance";file replication;peer-to-peer systems;proximity;"churn"",""Maintenance engineering";Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Internet;Vectors;Reliability;"Real-time systems"","""",""13"","""",""47"",""IEEE"",""11 Dec 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we present a new progressive algorithm, Pro-MLCS, based on the dominant point approach. Pro-MLCS can find an approximate solution quickly and then progressively generate better solutions until obtaining the optimal one. Pro-MLCS employs three new techniques: 1) a new heuristic function for prioritizing candidate points"; 2) a novel d-index-tree data structure for efficient computation of dominant points;" and 3) a new pruning method using an upper bound function and approximate solutions. Experimental results show that Pro-MLCS can obtain the first approximate solution almost instantly and needs only a very small fraction, e.g., 3 percent, of the entire running time to get the optimal solution. Compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, Pro-MLCS can find better solutions in much shorter time, one to two orders of magnitude faster. In addition, two parallel versions of Pro-MLCS are developed: DPro-MLCS for distributed memory architecture and DSDPro-MLCS for hierarchical distributed shared memory architecture.

This advantage, nonetheless, is at the expense of additional buffer space and bandwidth overhead. Thus, to achieve efficient utilization of network resources, it is important to come up with an effective message scheduling strategy to determine which messages should be forwarded and which should be dropped in case of buffer is full.

However, preserving the privacy of intermediate data sets becomes a challenging problem because adversaries may recover privacy-sensitive information by analyzing multiple intermediate data sets. Encrypting ALL data sets in cloud is widely adopted in existing approaches to address this challenge. But we argue that encrypting all intermediate data sets are neither efficient nor cost-effective because it is very time consuming and costly for data-intensive applications to en/decrypt data sets frequently while performing any operation on them. In this paper, we propose a novel upper bound privacy leakage constraint-based approach to identify which intermediate data sets need to be encrypted and which do not, so that privacy-preserving cost can be saved while the privacy requirements of data holders can still be satisfied.

The present study provides analysis of Random Network Coding (RNC) and Systematic Network Coding (SNC) decoding probabilities. Based on the analytical results, SNC is selected for developing an adaptive network coding scheme designated as Frame-by-frame Adaptive Systematic Network Coding (FASNC). According to network constraints per frame, FASNC dynamically utilizes either Modified Systematic Network Coding (M-SNC) or Mixed Generation Coding (MGC). An analytical model is developed for evaluating the mean decoding delay and mean goodput of the proposed FASNC scheme. The results derived using this model agree with those obtained from computer simulations. Simulations show that FASNC results in both lower decoding delay and reduced buffer requirements compared to MRNC and N-in-1 ReTX, while also yielding higher goodput than HARQ, MRNC, and N-in-1 ReTX."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.101"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6175012"",""Retransmission";MAC layer network coding;next generation broadband wireless access networks;decoding delay;"decoding probability"",""Decoding";Network coding;Encoding;Delay;Receivers;WiMAX;"Analytical models"","""",""17"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""3 Apr 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

When coupled with the technique of successive interference cancellation, by which a receiver may recover signals from multiple simultaneous senders, the model can lead to much reduced latency but increased energy usage. In this paper, we investigate the latency-energy tradeoff for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks under the physical interference model and using successive interference cancellation. We present theoretical lower bounds on both latency and energy as well as their tradeoff, and give an efficient approximation algorithm that can achieve the asymptotical optimum in both aggregation latency and latency-energy tradeoff.

In this context, task allocation techniques can be used to deal with heterogeneous cores and extend chip lifetime while minimizing energy and preserving quality of service. We propose a new formulation of the task allocation problem for variability affected platforms, which manages per-core utilization to achieve a target lifetime while minimizing energy consumption during the execution of rate-constrained multimedia applications.

The current trend in network design is to use as few components as possible to interconnect the end nodes, thereby reducing cost and power consumption. However, this increases the probability of congestion appearing in the network. As congestion may severely degrade network performance, the use of a congestion management mechanism is becoming mandatory in modern interconnects. One of the most cost-effective proposals to deal with the problems derived from congestion situations is the Regional Explicit Congestion Notification (RECN) strategy, based on using special queues to totally isolate the packet flows which contribute to congestion, thereby preventing the Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking effect that these flows may cause to others. Unfortunately, RECN requires the use of source-based routing, thus not being suitable for interconnects with distributed routing, like InfiniBand. Although some RECN-like mechanisms have been proposed for distributed-routing networks, they are not scalable due to the huge amount of control memory that they require in medium-size or large networks. In this paper, we propose Distributed-Routing-Based Congestion Management (DRBCM), a new scalable technique which, following the RECN principles, totally prevents congestion from producing HoL-blocking in multistage interconnection networks (MINs) using tag-based distributed routing. Simulation results indicate that, regardless of network size, DRBCM presents small resource requirements to keep network performance at maximum level even in scenarios of heavy congestion, where it utterly outperforms (with a gain up to 70 percent) current solutions for distributed-routing networks, like the InfiniBand congestion-control mechanism based on injection throttling.

Some existing remote integrity checking methods can only serve for static archive data and, thus, cannot be applied to the auditing service since the data in the cloud can be dynamically updated. Thus, an efficient and secure dynamic auditing protocol is desired to convince data owners that the data are correctly stored in the cloud.

A good buffer cache management scheme should be beneficial to not only the computational components, but also the storage components by reducing disk I/Os. Existing cache replacement algorithms are well optimized for disks in normal mode, but inefficient under faulty scenarios, such as a parity-based disk array with faulty disk(s). To address this issue, we propose a novel penalty-aware buffer cache replacement strategy, named Victim Disk(s) First (VDF) cache, to improve the reliability and performance of a storage system consisting of a buffer cache and disk arrays. VDF cache gives higher priority to cache the blocks on the faulty disks when the disk array fails, thus reducing the I/Os addressed directly to the faulty disks. To verify the effectiveness of the VDF cache, we have integrated VDF into the popular cache algorithms least frequently used (LFU) and least recently used (LRU), named VDF-LFU and VDF-LRU, respectively. We have conducted intensive simulations as well as a prototype implementation for disk arrays to tolerate one disk failure (RAID-5) and two disk failures (RAID-6). The simulation results have shown that VDF-LFU can reduce disk I/Os to surviving disks by up to 42.3 percent in RAID-5 and 50.7 percent in RAID-6, and VDF-LRU can reduce those by up to 36.2 percent in RAID-5 and 48.9 percent in RAID-6.

In this paper, we propose an iterative divide-and-merge-based estimator for solving large-scale LSE problems. Iteratively, the LSE problem to be solved is processed and transformed to equivalent but smaller LSE problems. In each iteration, the input matrices are subdivided into a set of small submatrices. The submatrices are decomposed by SVD, respectively, and the results are merged, and the resulting matrices become the input of the next iteration. The process is iterated until the resulting matrices are small enough which can then be solved directly and efficiently by SVD. The number of iterations required is determined dynamically according to the size of the input data set. As a result, the requirements in time and space for finding least squares solutions are greatly improved. Furthermore, the decomposition and merging of the submatrices in each iteration can be independently done in parallel.

In this paper, we present an analytical model for a hypercube-based social feature multipath routing protocol in DTNs. In this routing protocol, we use the internal social features of each node (individual) in the network for routing guidance. This approach is motivated from several real social contact networks, which show that people contact each other more when they have more social features in common. This routing scheme converts a routing problem in a highly mobile and unstructured contact space (M-space) to a static and structured feature space (F-space). The multipath routing process is a hypercube-based feature matching process where the social feature differences are resolved step-by-step. A feature matching shortcut algorithm for fast searching is presented where more than one feature difference is resolved at one time. The multiple paths for the routing process are node-disjoint. We formally analyze the delivery rate and latency by using hypercube-based routing.

Existing media access control (MAC) protocols like carrier sense multiple access always try to minimize the number of concurrent transmissions to avoid collision, although collisions at sender sides are harmless to the overall performance. The reason for such conservative strategy is that those protocols cannot obtain accurate channel status (who is transmitting and receiving) with low cost. They can only avoid potential collisions through rough channel status (idle or busy). To obtain additional information in a cost-efficient way, we propose a novel coding scheme, Attachment Coding, to allow control information to be “attached” on data packet. Nodes then transmit two kinds of signals simultaneously, without degrading the effective throughput of the original data traffic. Based on Attachment Coding, we propose an Attached-RTS MAC (AR-MAC) to exploit exposed terminals for concurrent transmissions. The attached control information provides accurate channel status for nodes in real time. Therefore, nodes can identify exposed terminals and utilize them for concurrent transmission. We theoretically analyze the feasibility of Attachment Coding, and implement it on the GNU Radio testbed to further verify it. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of Attached-RTS.

Since sensor nodes are usually much dense, data sampled by sensor nodes have much redundancy, data aggregation becomes an effective method to eliminate redundancy, minimize the number of transmission, and then to save energy. Many applications can be deployed in WSNs and various sensors are embedded in nodes, the packets generated by heterogenous sensors or different applications have different attributes. The packets from different applications cannot be aggregated. Otherwise, most data aggregation schemes employ static routing protocols, which cannot dynamically or intentionally forward packets according to network state or packet types. The spatial isolation caused by static routing protocol is unfavorable to data aggregation. To make data aggregation more efficient, in this paper, we introduce the concept of packet attribute, defined as the identifier of the data sampled by different kinds of sensors or applications, and then propose an attribute-aware data aggregation (ADA) scheme consisting of a packet-driven timing algorithm and a special dynamic routing protocol. Inspired by the concept of potential in physics and pheromone in ant colony, a potential-based dynamic routing is elaborated to support an ADA strategy. The performance evaluation results in series of scenarios verify that the ADA scheme can make the packets with the same attribute spatially convergent as much as possible and therefore improve the efficiency of data aggregation. Furthermore, the ADA scheme also offers other properties, such as scalable with respect to network size and adaptable for tracking mobile events."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.209"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6235954"",""Wireless sensor network";data aggregation;attribute-aware;dynamic routing;"potential field"",""Routing";Wireless sensor networks;Routing protocols;Heuristic algorithms;Timing;"Force"","""",""51"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""10 Jul 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

It aims to improve the electric system's reliability, security, and efficiency through two-way communication of consumption data and dynamic optimization of electric-system operations, maintenance, and planning. The smart grid systems use fine-grained power grid measurements to provide increased grid stability and reliability. Key to achieving this is securely sharing the measurements among grid entities over wide area networks. Typically, such sharing follows policies that depend on data generator and consumer preferences and on time-sensitive contexts. In smart grid, as well as the data, policies for sharing the data may be sensitive because they directly contain sensitive information, and reveal information about underlying data protected by the policy, or about the data owner or recipients. In this study, we propose an attribute-based data sharing scheme in smart grid. Not only the data but also the access policies are obfuscated in grid operators' point of view during the data sharing process. Thus, the data privacy and policy privacy are preserved in the proposed scheme. The access policy can be expressed with any arbitrary access formula. Thus, the expressiveness of the policy is enhanced. The security is also improved such that the unauthorized key generation center or the grid manage systems that store the data cannot decrypt the data to be shared. The computation overhead of recipients are also reduced by delegating most of the laborious decryption operations to the more powerful grid manage systems."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.61"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613499"",""Smart grid";policy-based data sharing;privacy;"security"",""Smart grids";Encryption;Data privacy;Receivers;"Generators"","""",""81"","""",""20"",""IEEE"",""27 Sep 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The three proposed protocols are based on a binary tree slotted ALOHA (BTSA) algorithm. In BTSA, tags are randomly assigned to slots of a frame and if some tags collide in a slot, the collided tags in the slot will be resolved by binary tree splitting while the other tags in the subsequent slots will wait. The three protocols utilize a dynamic, an adaptive, and a splitting method to adjust the frame length to a value close to the number of tags, respectively. For BTSA, the identification efficiency can achieve an optimal value only when the frame length is close to the number of tags. Therefore, the proposed protocols efficiency is close to the optimal value. The advantages of the protocols are that, they do not need the estimation of the number of tags, and their efficiency is not affected by the variance of the number of tags. Computer simulation results show that splitting BTSA's efficiency can achieve 0.425, and the other two protocols efficiencies are about 0.40.

Virtual backbone construction based on Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is a competitive approach among the existing methods used to establish virtual backbone in WSNs. Traditionally, CDS size was the only factor considered in the CDS-based approach. The motivation was that smaller CDS leads to simplified network maintenance. However, routing cost in terms of routing path length is also an important factor for virtual backbone construction. In our research, both of these two factors are taken into account. Specifically, we attempt to devise a polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm that leads to a CDS with bounded CDS size and guaranteed routing cost. We prove that, under general graph model, there is no polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm unless P = NP. Under Unit Disk Graph (UDG) model, we propose an innovative polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm, GOC-MCDS-C, that produces a CDS D whose size I D is within a constant factor from that of the minimum CDS.

Erasure coding can be applied to mitigate the dependency of feedback in such a disruptive network condition, improving data collection. However, the collaborative data collection through an in-network erasure coding approach has been underexplored. In this paper, we present an Opportunistic Network Erasure Coding protocol (ONEC) to collaboratively collect data in dynamic disruptive networks. ONEC derives the probability distribution of coding degree in each node and enables opportunistic in-network recoding, and guarantees that the recovery of original sensor data can be achieved with high probability upon receiving any sufficient amount of encoded packets. First, it develops a recursive decomposition structure to conduct probability distribution deconvolution, supporting heterogeneous data rates. Second, every node conducts selective in-network recoding of its own sensing data and received packets, including those opportunistic overheard packets. Last, ONEC can efficiently recover raw data from received encoded packets, taking advantages of low decoding complexity of erasure codes. We evaluate and show that our ONEC can achieve efficient data collection in various disruptive network settings. Moreover, ONEC outperforms other epidemic network coding approaches in terms of network goodput, communication cost, and energy consumption."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.231"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6255739"",""Disruptive sensor networks";opportunistic network coding;"erasure codes"",""Encoding";Decoding;Deconvolution;Complexity theory;Network coding;Distributed databases;"Reliability"","""",""11"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""31 Jul 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hence, such communities are unable to benefit significantly from caching and replication that focus only on the most dominant queries. A community-based caching (CBC) solution that enhances both community-wide and system-wide lookup performance is proposed. CBC consists of a suboverlay formation scheme and a local-knowledge-based distributed caching (LKDC) algorithm. Suboverlays enable communities to forward queries through their members. While queries are forwarded, the LKDC algorithm causes members to identify and cache resources of interests to them, resulting in faster resolution of queries for popular resources within each community. Distributed local caching requires global information (e.g., hop count and popularity of contents) that is difficult and costly to obtain. However, by means of an analysis of globally optimal behavior and structural properties of the overlay, we developed the heuristic-based LKDC algorithm that not only relies on purely local information but also provides close-to-optimal caching performance.

Using a complete-convexification method, we first propose a message-passing distributed algorithm that can attain the global optimal source rate and link power allocation. Despite the attractiveness of its optimality, this algorithm requires larger message size than that of the conventional scheme, which increases network overheads. Using the bounds on outage probability, we map the outage constraint to an SIR constraint and continue developing a practical near-optimal distributed algorithm requiring only local SIR measurement at link receivers to limit the size of the message. Due to the complicated complete-convexification method, however the congestion control of both algorithms no longer preserves the existing TCP stack. To take into account the TCP stack preserving property, we propose the third algorithm using a successive convex approximation method to iteratively transform the original nonconvex problem into approximated convex problems, then the global optimal solution can converge distributively with message-passing. Thanks to the tightness of the bounds and successive approximations, numerical results show that the gap between three algorithms is almost indistinguishable. Despite the same type of the complete-convexification method, the numerical comparison shows that the second near-optimal scheme has a faster convergence rate than that of the first optimal one, which make the near-optimal scheme more favorable and applicable in practice.

Existing efforts in this line highly depend on the boundary detection algorithms, which are used to extract accurate boundary nodes. One challenge is that in practical this could limit the applicability of the boundary detection algorithms. For instance, in low node density networks where boundary detection algorithms do not work well, the extracted boundary nodes are often incomplete. This paper brings a new view to skeleton extraction from a distance transform perspective, bridging the distance transform of the network and the incomplete boundaries. As such, we propose a distributed and scalable algorithm for skeleton extraction, called DIST, based on DIStance Transform, while incurring low communication overhead. The proposed algorithm does not require that the boundaries are complete or accurate, which makes the proposed algorithm more practical in applications. First, we compute the distance transform of the network. Specifically, the distance (hop count) of each node to the boundaries of a sensor network is estimated. The node map consisting of the distance values is considered as the distance transform (the distance map). The distance map is then used to identify skeleton nodes. Next, skeleton arcs are generated by controlled flooding within the identified skeleton nodes, thereby connecting these skeleton arcs, to extract a coarse skeleton. Finally, we refine the coarse skeleton by building shortest path trees followed by a prune phase. The obtained skeleton is robust to boundary noise or shape variations.

As one of the key components in mobility management support, location management serves the purpose of tracking mobile users and locating them prior to establishing new communications. Previous dynamic location management schemes proposed for cellular and wireless local area networks (WLANs) cannot be directly applied to WMNs due to the existence of multihop wireless links in WMNs. Moreover, new design challenges arise when applying location management for silently roaming mobile users in the mesh backbone. Considering the number of wireless hops, an important factor affecting the performance of WMNs, we propose a DoMaIN framework that can help mobile users to decide whether an intra- or intergateway location update (LU) is needed to ensure the best location management performance (i.e., packet delivery) among dynamic location management solutions. In addition, by dynamically guiding mobile users to perform LU to a desirable location entity, the proposed DoMaIN framework can minimize the location management protocol overhead in terms of LU overhead in the mesh backbone. Furthermore, DoMaIN brings extra benefits for supporting a dynamic hop-based LU triggering method that is different from previous dynamic LU triggering schemes proposed for cellular networks and WLANs. We evaluate the performance of DoMaIN in different case studies using OPNET simulations.

Toward this new architecture where each participant may autonomously act as both resource consumer and provider, we propose a fully distributed, VM-multiplexing resource allocation scheme to manage decentralized resources. Our approach not only achieves maximized resource utilization using the proportional share model (PSM), but also delivers provably and adaptively optimal execution efficiency.

Contrary to existing solutions which often generate bulky messages per request, our protocol produces only one lightweight query message per task on the Content Addressable Network (CAN).

In this work, we present two simple ways to improve handling of speculative stores--a way to effectively manage lines that exhibit migratory sharing and a way to hide store latency, particularly for those stores that target contended cache lines owned by other concurrent transactions. These two mechanisms yield substantial improvements in execution time when running applications with high contention, allowing eager designs to exceed the performance of lazy ones. Interestingly, the benefits that accrue from these enhancements can be at par with those achieved using more complex system-wide HTM techniques.

In this paper, we propose a computational efficient method to compute a weighted average (which we will call robust average) of sensor measurements, which appropriately takes sensor faults and sensor noise into consideration. We assume that the sensors in the WSN use random projections to compress the data and send the compressed data to the data fusion centre. Computational efficiency of our method is achieved by having the data fusion centre work directly with the compressed data streams.

We find that the use of the directory as a mere router of coherence requests restricts the throughput of conflict detection, and show how it becomes a bottleneck under high contention. This paper proposes a scheme for conflict detection that decouples conflict detection from cache coherence in order to overcome pathological situations that degrade the performance of an eager HTM system. Our scheme places bookkeeping metadata at the directory, introducing it as a separate hardware module that leaves the coherence protocol unmodified.

CCDSV solves several important issues in a practical system, like the robustness to mobility prediction errors, limited resources of APs and the shared content distribution. Our system organizes the cooperative APs into a novel structure, namely, the contact map which is based on the vehicular contact patterns observed by APs. To fully utilize the wireless bandwidth provided by APs, we propose a representative-based prefetching mechanism, in which a set of representative APs are carefully selected and then share their prefetched data with others. The selection process explicitly takes into account the AP's storage capacity, storage status, inter-APs bandwidth and traffic loads on the backhaul links.

An interesting zapping acceleration scheme based on time-shifted subchannels (TSS) was recently proposed, which can ensure a zapping delay bound as well as maintain the picture quality during zapping. However, the behaviors of the TSS-based scheme have not been fully studied yet. Furthermore, the existing TSS-based implementation adopts the traditional IP multicast, which is not scalable for a large-scale distributed system. Corresponding to such issues, this paper makes contributions in two aspects. First, we resort to theoretical analysis to understand the fundamental properties of the TSS-based service model. We show that there exists an optimal subchannel data rate which minimizes the redundant traffic transmitted over subchannels. Moreover, we reveal a start-up effect, where the existing operation pattern in the TSS-based model could violate the zapping delay bound. With a solution proposed to resolve the start-up effect, we rigorously prove that a zapping delay bound equal to the subchannel time shift is guaranteed by the updated TSS-based model. Second, we propose a destination-oriented-multicast (DOM) assisted zapping acceleration (DAZA) scheme for a scalable TSS-based implementation, where a subscriber can seamlessly migrate from a subchannel to the main channel after zapping without any control message exchange over the network. Moreover, the subchannel selection in DAZA is independent of the zapping request signaling delay, resulting in improved robustness and reduced messaging overhead in a distributed environment. We implement DAZA in ns-2 and multicast an MPEG-4 video stream over a practical network topology. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of our analysis and DAZA scheme."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.94"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6171172"",""IPTV";channel zapping;time-shifted subchannels;"destination oriented multicast"",""Delay";Streaming media;IP networks;IPTV;Acceleration;Indexes;"Analytical models"","""",""13"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""19 Mar 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To tolerate f crash faults (dead/unresponsive data structures) among n distinct data structures, replication requires f + 1 replicas of each data structure, resulting in nf additional backups.

We show that our solution achieves O(n) savings in space over replication. Further, we present a solution to tolerate f Byzantine faults (malicious data structures), that requires only nf + f backups as compared to the 2nf backups required by replication. We explore the theory of fused backups and provide a library of such backups for all the data structures in the Java Collection Framework. The theoretical and experimental evaluation confirms that the fused backups are space-efficient as compared to replication, while they cause very little overhead for normal operation. To illustrate the practical usefulness of fusion, we use fused backups for reliability in Amazon's highly available key-value store, Dynamo.

While the gathering problem cannot be solved deterministically without assuming any additional capabilities for the robots, randomized approaches easily allow it to be solvable. However, the randomized solutions currently known have a time complexity that is exponential in n with no additional assumption. This fact yields the following two questions: Is it possible to construct a randomized gathering algorithm with polynomial expected time? If it is not possible, what is the minimal additional assumption necessary to obtain such an algorithm? In this paper, we address these questions from the aspect of multiplicity-detection capabilities. We newly introduce two weaker variants of multiplicity detection, called local-strong and local-weak multiplicity, and investigate whether those capabilities permit a gathering algorithm with polynomial expected time or not. The contribution of this paper is to show that any algorithm only assuming local-weak multiplicity detection takes exponential number of rounds in expectation. On the other hand, we can obtain a constant-round gathering algorithm using local-strong multiplicity detection. These results imply that the two models of multiplicity detection are significantly different in terms of their computational power. Interestingly, these differences disappear if we take one more assumption that all robots are scattered (i.e., no two robots stay at the same location) initially. We can obtain a gathering algorithm that takes a constant number of rounds in expectation, assuming local-weak multiplicity detection and scattered initial configurations."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.212"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471719"",""Distributed algorithm";autonomous mobile robots;gathering problem;"randomized algorithm"",""Robot kinematics";Algorithm design and analysis;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Polynomials;"Diamonds"","""",""15"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""7 Mar 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since these algorithms typically assume the underlying logical overlay topology is fully connected, the number of control messages exchanged among the whole processes is proportional to the square of number of processes, resulting in higher possibility of network congestion. Hence, such algorithms are neither efficient nor scalable for a large-scale distributed system composed of a huge number of processes. Recently, some efforts have been presented to significantly reduce the number of control messages, but doing so incurs higher response time instead. In this paper, we propose an efficient global-snapshot algorithm able to let every process finish its local snapshot in a given number of rounds. Particularly, such an algorithm allows a tradeoff between the response time and the message complexity. Moreover, our global-snapshot algorithm is symmetrical in the sense that identical steps are executed by every process. This means that our algorithm is able to achieve better workload balance and less network congestion. Most importantly, based on our framework, we demonstrate that the minimum number of control messages required by a symmetrical global-snapshot algorithm is Ω(N log N), where N is the number of processes.

To address these challenges, we propose the property detection for asynchronous context (PDAC) framework, which consists of three essential parts: 1) Logical time is employed to model the temporal evolution of environment state as a lattice. The active surface of the lattice is introduced as the key notion to model the runtime evolution of the environment state"; 2) Specification of dynamic properties is viewed as a formal language defined over the trace of environment state evolution;" and 3) The SurfMaint algorithm is proposed to achieve runtime maintenance of the active surface of the lattice, which further enables runtime detection of dynamic properties. A case study is conducted to demonstrate how the PDAC framework enables context awareness in asynchronous pervasive computing scenarios. The SurfMaint algorithm is implemented and evaluated over MIPA--the open-source context-aware middleware we developed. Performance measurements show the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of SurfMaint, even when faced with dynamic changes in the asynchronous pervasive computing environment."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.259"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295610"",""Lattices";Runtime;Labeling;Pervasive computing;Context;Heuristic algorithms;Formal languages;lattice;Dynamic property;context awareness;asynchrony;"predicate detection"",""Lattices";Runtime;Labeling;Pervasive computing;Context;Heuristic algorithms;"Formal languages"","""",""9"","""",""40"",""IEEE"",""5 Sep 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals"""

However, some applications may require different degrees of detection probability at different locations. For example, an intrusion detection application may need improved detection probability around important entities. Gaussian-distributed WSNs can provide differentiated detection capabilities at different locations but related work is limited. This paper analyzes the problem of intrusion detection in a Gaussian-distributed WSN by characterizing the detection probability with respect to the application requirements and the network parameters under both single-sensing detection and multiple-sensing detection scenarios. Effects of different network parameters on the detection probability are examined in detail. Furthermore, performance of Gaussian-distributed WSNs is compared with uniformly distributed WSNs.

We first explore several realistic data sets to reveal both geographic and social regularities of human mobility, and further propose the concepts of geocommunity and geocentrality into MSNet analysis. Then, we employ a semi-Markov process to model user mobility based on the geocommunity structure of the network. Correspondingly, the geocentrality indicating the “dynamic user density” of each geocommunity can be derived from the semi-Markov model. Finally, considering the geocentrality information, we provide different route algorithms to cater to the superuser that wants to either minimize total duration or maximize dissemination ratio.

Signatures are commonly implemented as two separate same-sized Bloom filters, one for reads and other for writes. In contrast, transactions frequently exhibit read and write sets of uneven cardinality. This mismatch between data sets and filter storage introduces inefficiencies in the use of signatures that have some impact on performance. This paper presents different signature designs as alternatives to the common scheme to deal with the asymmetry in transactional data sets in an effective way. Basically, we analyze two classes of new signatures, called multiset and reconfigurable asymmetric signatures. The first class uses only one Bloom filter to track both read and write sets, while the second class uses Bloom filters of configurable size for reads and writes. The main focus of this paper is a thorough study of these alternative signature designs, including a statistical analysis of false positives and an experimental evaluation, providing performance results and hardware area, time and energy requirements."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.138"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6197181"",""Hardware transactional memory";Bloom filter;signatures;conflict detection;locality;multiset;"asymmetric"",""Random access memory";Logic gates;Hardware;Arrays;Indexes;Registers;"Programming"","""",""11"","""",""35"",""IEEE"",""8 May 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Because applying traditional approaches like Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition (aka. direct method) to such large-scale LEs would be prohibitively expensive, we build the secure LE outsourcing mechanism via a completely different approach-iterative method, which is much easier to implement in practice and only demands relatively simpler matrix-vector operations. Specifically, our mechanism enables a customer to securely harness the cloud for iteratively finding successive approximations to the LE solution, while keeping both the sensitive input and output of the computation private. For robust cheating detection, we further explore the algebraic property of matrix-vector operations and propose an efficient result verification mechanism, which allows the customer to verify all answers received from previous iterative approximations in one batch with high probability.

The goal is to find an allocation such that the number of clients assigned to a server is smaller than the server's degree and their overall demand is smaller than the server's capacity, while maximizing the overall throughput. This problem has several natural applications in the context of independent tasks scheduling or virtual machines allocation. We consider both the offline (when clients are known beforehand) and the online (when clients can join and leave the system at any time) versions of the problem. We first show that the degree constraint on the maximal number of clients that a server can handle is realistic in many contexts. Then, our main contribution is to prove that even if it makes the allocation problem more difficult (NP-Complete), a very small additive resource augmentation on the servers degree is enough to find in polynomial time a solution that achieves at least the optimal throughput.

Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) is one of the widely used localization schemes, in which the target (source) emits a signal and a number of anchors (receivers) record the arriving time of the source signal. By calculating the time difference of different receivers, the location of the target is estimated. In such a scheme, receivers must be precisely time synchronized. But time synchronization adds computational cost, and brings errors which may lower localization accuracy. Previous studies have shown that existing time synchronization approaches using low-cost devices are insufficiently accurate, or even infeasible under high requirement for accuracy. In our scheme (called Whistle), several asynchronous receivers record a target signal and a successive signal that is generated artificially. By two-signal sensing and sample counting techniques, time synchronization requirement can be removed, while high time resolution can be achieved. This design fundamentally changes TDOA in the sense of releasing the synchronization requirement and avoiding many sources of errors caused by time synchronization. We implement Whistle on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cell phones with acoustic signal and perform simulations with UWB signal. Especially we use Whistle to localize nodes of large-scale wireless networks, and also achieve desirable results.

Current cloud interface abstractions restrict users from providing information regarding usage patterns of their requested virtual machines (VMs). In this paper, we propose Nefeli, a virtual infrastructure gateway that lifts this restriction. Through Nefeli, cloud consumers provide deployment hints on the possible mapping of VMs to physical nodes. Such hints include the collocation and anticollocation of VMs, the existence of potential performance bottlenecks, the presence of underlying hardware features (e.g., high availability), the proximity of certain VMs to data repositories, or any other information that would contribute in a more effective placement of VMs to physical hosting nodes. Consumers designate only properties of their virtual infrastructure and remain at all times agnostic to the cloud internal physical characteristics. The set of consumer-provided hints is augmented with high-level placement policies specified by the cloud administration. Placement policies and hints form a constraint satisfaction problem that when solved, yields the final VM-to-host placement. As workloads executed by the cloud may change over time, VM-to-host mappings must follow suit. To this end, Nefeli captures such events, changes VM deployment, helps avoid bottlenecks, and ultimately, improves the quality of the rendered services. Using our prototype, we examine overheads involved and show significant improvements in terms of time needed to execute scientific and real application workloads. We also demonstrate how power-aware policies may reduce the energy consumption of the physical installation.

Nevertheless, performance of the entire system may be highly degraded due to the presence of malicious peers that share bogus data on purpose. In this paper, we propose to use a statistical inference technique, namely, belief propagation (BP), to estimate the probability of peers being malicious. The detection algorithm is run by a set of trusted monitor nodes that receives notification messages (checks) from peers whenever they obtain a chunk of data";" these checks contain the list of the chunk uploaders and a flag to mark the chunk as polluted or clean. Peers are able to detect if the received chunk is polluted or not but, since multiparty download is employed, they are not capable to identify the source(s) of bogus blocks.

To overcome filtering policies or protect the privacy of their users, most of these applications implement mechanisms such as protocol obfuscation or payload encryption that avoid the inspection of their traffic, making it difficult to identify its nature. The incapacity to determine the application that is responsible for a certain flow raises challenges for the effective management of the network. In this paper, a new method for the identification of VoIP sessions is presented. The proposed mechanism classifies the flows, in real-time, based on the speech codec used in the session. To make the classification lightweight, the behavioral signatures for each analyzed codec were created using only the lengths of the packets. Unlike most previous approaches, the classifier does not use the lengths of the packets individually. Instead, it explores their level of heterogeneity in real time, using entropy to emphasize such feature. The results of the performance evaluation show that the proposed method is able to identify VoIP sessions accurately and simultaneously recognize the used speech codec."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.316"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378361"",""Data communications";distributed applications;network communications;network management;network monitoring;"packet-switching networks"",""Payloads";Entropy;Protocols;Speech codecs;"Phase change materials"","""",""10"","""",""41"",""IEEE"",""11 Dec 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

Numerous challenging problems have to be overcome-among them providing low delay, resilience to churn, effective load balancing, and rapid convergence-in such dynamic environments. We propose a novel P2P overlay dissemination mechanism, termed IDM, that can satisfy such demanding real-time requirements. Our target application is to provide spatialized voice support in multiplayer NVEs, where each bandwidth constrained peer potentially communicates with all other peers within its area-of-interest (AoI). With IDM each peer maintains a set of partners, termed helpers, which may act as stream forwarders. We prove analytically that the system reachability is maximized when the loads of helpers are balanced proportionally to their network capacities. We then propose a game-theoretic algorithm that balances the loads of the peers in a fully distributed manner. Of practical importance in dynamic systems, we prove that our algorithm converges to an approximately balanced state from any prior state in rapid O(\log \log n) time, where n is the number of users.

These bugs severely impact the productivity of a large number of users, causing program failures or other errors. As a result, MPI application developers often have to spend days or weeks in vain debugging their own code. To address this daunting problem, this paper presents a new method called FlowChecker, which detects communication related bugs in MPI libraries. First, FlowChecker extracts program intentions of message passing (MP-intentions), which specify messages to be delivered from the sources to the destinations. Then FlowChecker tracks the message flows that actually occur in the underlying MPI libraries. Finally, FlowChecker checks whether the messages are correctly delivered from the sources to the destinations by comparing the message flows against the MP-intentions. If a mismatch is found, FlowChecker reports a bug and provides diagnostic information to help MPI library developers to understand and fix it. We have built a FlowChecker prototype on Linux and evaluated it with five real-world and two injected bug cases in three widely used MPI libraries, including Open MPI, MPICH2, and MVAPICH2. Our experimental results show that FlowChecker effectively detects all seven evaluated bug cases. Additionally, it provides useful diagnostic information for narrowing down or even pinpointing root causes of the bugs. Moreover, our experiments with High Performance Linpack and NAS Parallel Benchmarks show that FlowChecker induces low runtime overhead (0.9-5.6 percent on Open MPI, 0.9-8.1 percent on MPICH2, and 1.6-9.7 percent on MVAPICH2)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.127"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416896"",""Software reliability";bug detection;"message passing interfaces"",""Libraries";Computer bugs;Software;Tracking;Runtime;Semantics;"Message passing"","""","""","""",""60"",""IEEE"",""22 Jan 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

In fulfilling this goal, a TM system should maximize its performance with limited hardware resources. Conflict detection is an essential element for maintaining correctness among concurrent transactions in a TM system. Hardware signatures have been proposed as an area-efficient method for detecting conflicts. However, signatures can degrade TM performance by falsely declaring conflicts. Hence, improving the accuracy of signatures within a given hardware budget is a crucial issue for TM to be adopted as a mainstream programming model. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective signature design, the unified signature. Instead of using separate read- and write-signatures, we implement a single signature to track all read- and write-accesses. By merging read- and write-signatures, a unified signature can effectively enlarge the signature coverage without additional overhead. Within the constraints of a given hardware budget, a TM system with a unified signature outperforms a baseline system with the same-sized traditional signatures by reducing the number of falsely detected conflicts. Even though the unified signature scheme incurs read-read dependencies, we show that these false dependencies do not negate the benefit of unified signatures and can effectively be filtered out. A TM system with a 2-Kbit unified signature with a helper signature scheme achieves speedups of 15 percent over baseline TM with 33 percent less area and 49 percent less power."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.292"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327189"",""Hardware transactional memory";conflict detection;Bloom filters;signatures;"unified signatures"",""Hardware";Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Merging;Indexes;"Monitoring"","""",""5"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""8 Oct 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For accurately estimating a process state as well as satisfying rigid delay constraints, we address the problem through jointly designing in-network estimation operations and an aggregation scheduling algorithm.

Sensor network technology has recently been adopted for data-center thermal monitoring because of its nonintrusive nature for the already complex data center facilities and robustness to instantaneous CPU or disk activities. However, existing solutions place sensors in a simplistic way without considering the thermal dynamics in data centers, resulting in unnecessarily degraded hot server detection probability. In this paper, we first formulate the problems of sensor placement for hot server detection in a data center as constrained optimization problems in two different scenarios. We then propose a novel placement scheme based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to take various factors, such as cooling systems and server layout, as inputs to analyze the thermal conditions of the data center. Based on the CFD analysis in various server overheating scenarios, we apply data fusion and advanced optimization techniques to find a near-optimal sensor placement solution, such that the probability of detecting hot servers is significantly improved. Our empirical results in a real server room demonstrate the detection performance of our placement solution. Extensive simulation results in a large-scale data center with 32 racks also show that the proposed solution outperforms several commonly used placement solutions in terms of detection probability."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.254"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295619"",""Servers";Computational fluid dynamics;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor networks;power management;Data centers;servers;sensor placement;thermal monitoring;"computational fluid dynamics"",""Servers";Computational fluid dynamics;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;"Wireless sensor networks"","""",""26"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""5 Sep 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";

But we discover a more probable rule - with high probability the shortest delay comes from the closest distance. Based on this closest-shortest rule, we develop a simple and novel IP-geolocation mapping scheme for moderately connected Internet regions, called GeoGet. In GeoGet, we take a large number of webservers as passive landmarks and map a targeted client to the geolocation of the landmark that has the shortest delay. We further use JavaScript at targeted clients to generate HTTP/Get probing for delay measurement. To control the measurement cost, we adopt a multistep probing method to refine the geolocation of a targeted client, finally to city level.

In addition, most of the algorithms which make searching in unstructured P2P systems scalable, such as dynamic querying and 1-hop replication, rely on the random nature of the overlay to function efficiently. The underlying communications network (i.e., the Internet), however, is not as randomly constructed. This leads to a mismatch between the distance of two peers on the overlay and the hosts they reside on at the IP layer, which in turn leads to its misuse. The crux of the problem arises from the fact that any effort to provide a better match between the overlay and the IP layer will inevitably lead to a reduction in the random structure of the P2P overlay, with many adverse results. With this in mind, we propose ITA, an algorithm which creates a random overlay of randomly connected neighborhoods providing topology awareness to P2P systems, while at the same time has no negative effect on the self-* properties or the operation of the other P2P algorithms. Using extensive simulations, both at the IP router level and autonomous system level, we show that ITA reduces communication latencies by as much as 50 percent. Furthermore, it not only reduces by 20 percent the number of IP network messages which is critical for ISPs carrying the burden of transporting P2P traffic, but also distributes the traffic load more evenly on the routers of the IP network layer."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.137"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6197180"",""Peer to peer computing";IP networks;Topology;Proposals;Clustering algorithms;Network topology;Heuristic algorithms;communication latency;Peer-to-peer;unstructured overlay network;topology awareness;self-* properties;"IP network layer"",""Peer to peer computing";IP networks;Topology;Proposals;Clustering algorithms;Network topology;"Heuristic algorithms"","""",""5"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""8 May 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;

When sensor nodes are deployed in hostile environments, the localization schemes are vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., wormhole attack, pollution attack, range enlargement/reduction attack, and etc. Therefore, sensors' locations are not trustworthy and need to be verified before they can be used by location-based applications. Previous verification schemes either require group-based deployment knowledge of the sensor field, or depend on expensive or dedicated hardware, thus they cannot be used for low-cost sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight location verification system that performs both “on-spot” and “in-region” location verifications. The on-spot verification intends to verify whether the locations claimed by sensors are far from their true spots beyond a certain distance. We propose two algorithms that detect abnormal locations by exploring the inconsistencies between sensors' claimed locations and their neighborhood observations. The in-region verification verifies whether a sensor is inside an application-specific verification region. Compared to on-spot verification, the in-region verification is tolerable to large errors as long as the locations of sensors don't cause the application to malfunction. We study how to derive the verification region for different applications and design a probabilistic algorithm to compute in-region confidence for each sensor. Experiment results show that our on-spot and in-region algorithms can verify sensors' locations with high detection rate and low false positive rate. They are robust in the presence of malicious attacks that are launched during the verification process. Moreover, compared with previous verification schemes, our algorithms are effective and lightweight because they do not rely on the knowledge of deployment of sensors, and they don't require expensive or dedicated hardware, so our algorithms can be used in any low-cost sensor networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.42"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143922"",""Localization";verification;on-spot;in-region;security;"wireless sensor networks"",""Measurement";Silicon;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor systems;Filtering;"Handheld computers"","""",""50"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There exist large numbers of additional data streams, which could be transmitted concurrently with those data streams scheduled by stream control at certain time slots and vicinities. In this paper, we address the issue of MIMO link scheduling to maximize the gain of spatial reuse and thus network throughput. We propose a Receiver-Oriented Interference Suppression model (ROIS), based on which we design both centralized and distributed link scheduling algorithms to fully exploit the gain of spatial reuse in multihop MIMO networks. Further, we address the traffic-aware link scheduling problem by injecting nonuniform traffic load into the network. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive performance evaluation, we achieve the following results: 1) link scheduling based on ROIS achieves significant higher network throughput than that based on stream control, with any interference range, number of antennas, and average hop length of data flows. 2) The traffic-aware scheduling is enticingly complementary to the link scheduling based on ROIS model.

This dependence is clearly inadequate in a large-scale, failure-prone environment because the central load balancer is put under considerable workload that is linearly scaled with the system size, and may thus become the performance bottleneck and the single point of failure. In this paper, a fully distributed load rebalancing algorithm is presented to cope with the load imbalance problem. Our algorithm is compared against a centralized approach in a production system and a competing distributed solution presented in the literature. The simulation results indicate that our proposal is comparable with the existing centralized approach and considerably outperforms the prior distributed algorithm in terms of load imbalance factor, movement cost, and algorithmic overhead. The performance of our proposal implemented in the Hadoop distributed file system is further investigated in a cluster environment."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.196"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226382"",""Load balance";distributed file systems;"clouds"",""Proposals";Load management;Algorithm design and analysis;Vectors;Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;"Clustering algorithms"","""",""98"",""5"",""34"",""IEEE"",""26 Jun 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

Determining when it is best to reallocate VMs from an overloaded host is an aspect of dynamic VM consolidation that directly influences the resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) delivered by the system. The influence on the QoS is explained by the fact that server overloads cause resource shortages and performance degradation of applications. Current solutions to the problem of host overload detection are generally heuristic based, or rely on statistical analysis of historical data. The limitations of these approaches are that they lead to suboptimal results and do not allow explicit specification of a QoS goal. We propose a novel approach that for any known stationary workload and a given state configuration optimally solves the problem of host overload detection by maximizing the mean intermigration time under the specified QoS goal based on a Markov chain model. We heuristically adapt the algorithm to handle unknown nonstationary workloads using the Multisize Sliding Window workload estimation technique. Through simulations with workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs, we show that our approach outperforms the best benchmark algorithm and provides approximately 88 percent of the performance of the optimal offline algorithm."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.240"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269025"",""Distributed systems";cloud computing;virtualization;dynamic consolidation;energy efficiency;"host overload detection"",""Quality of service";Measurement;Detection algorithms;Resource management;Approximation algorithms;Servers;"Heuristic algorithms"","""",""348"",""3"",""26"",""IEEE"",""15 Aug 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By way of a simple sparse matrix Jacobi iterative solver, this paper illustrates some of the issues associated with mapping floating-point kernels onto HPRCs. The Jacobi method was chosen based on heuristics developed from earlier research. Furthermore, Jacobi is relatively easy to understand, yet is complex enough to illustrate the mapping issues. This paper is not trying to demonstrate the speedup of a particular application nor is it suggesting that Jacobi is the best way to solve equations. The results demonstrate a nearly threefold wall clock runtime speedup when compared with a software implementation. A formal analysis shows that these results are reasonable.

While a number of studies have been conducted at the client side to understand and characterize Internet mobile streaming delivery, little is known about the server side, particularly for the recent cloud-based Internet mobile streaming delivery. In this work, we aim to investigate the Internet mobile streaming service at the server side. For this purpose, we have collected a 4-month server-side log on the cloud (with 1,002 TB delivered video traffic) from a top Internet mobile streaming service provider serving worldwide mobile users. Through trace analysis, we find that 1) a major challenge for providing Internet mobile streaming services is rooted from the mobile device hardware and software heterogeneity. In this workload, we find over 3,400 different hardware models with more than 100 different screen resolutions running 14 different mobile OS and three audio codecs and four video codecs. 2) To deal with the device heterogeneity, CPU-intensive transcoding is used on the cloud to customize the video to the appropriate versions at runtime for different devices. A video clip could be transcoded into more than 40 different versions to serve requests from different devices. 3) Compared to videos in traditional Internet streaming, mobile streaming videos are typically of much smaller size (a median of 1.68 MBytes) and shorter duration (a median of 2.7 minutes). Furthermore, the daily mobile user accesses are more skewed following a Zipf-like distribution but users' interests also quickly shift. Considering the huge demand of CPU cycles for online transcoding, we further examine server-side caching to reduce the total CPU cycle demand from the cloud.

The MLCA augments a traditional multicore architecture (called the lower level) with a CP (called the top-level), which automatically extracts parallelism among coarse-grain units of computation (tasks), synchronizes these tasks and schedules them for execution on processors. It does so in a fashion similar to how instruction-level parallelism is extracted by superscalar processors, i.e., using register renaming, Out-of-Order Execution (OoOE) and scheduling. The coarse-grain nature of tasks imposes challenging constraints on the direct use of these techniques, but also offers opportunities for simpler designs. We analyze the impact of these constraints and opportunities and present novel microarchitectural mechanisms for coarse-grain superscalar execution, including register renaming, task queue, dynamic out-of-order scheduling and task-issue.

MIN-MAX is well suited for massive parallel processing architectures, such as FPGAs, yet it is effective on any other computing platform. In MIN-MAX, each active CCR engine (to implement one CCR term) evaluates input characters, updates (MIN, MAX) counters, and asserts control signals, and all the CCR engines implemented in the FPGA run simultaneously. Unlike traditional designs, (MIN, MAX) counters contain dynamically updated lower and upper bounds of possible matching counts, instead of actual matching counts, so that feasible matching lengths are compactly enclosed in the counter value. The counter-based design can support constraint repetitions of n using O({\rm log} n) memory bits rather than that of O(n) in existing solutions. MIN-MAX can resolve character class ambiguity between adjacent CCR terms and support overlapped matching when matching collisions are absent. We developed a set of heuristic rules to assess the absence of collision for CCR-based regexps, and tested them on Snort and SpamAssassin rule sets. The results show that the vast majority of rules are immune from collisions, so that MIN-MAX can cost effectively support overlapped matching.

For these surveillance applications, it is desirable to minimize the network cost while fulfilling the given lifetime requirement. In this paper, we address a new problem in which the network cost is minimized while the resulting lifetime is at least equal to a given value L.

The creation of new cyber-physical services based on wireless sensor devices relies heavily on how well communication protocols can be adapted and optimized to meet quality constraints under limited energy resources. The IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control protocol for wireless sensor networks can support energy efficient, reliable, and timely packet transmission by a parallel and distributed tuning of the medium access control parameters. Such a tuning is difficult, because simple and accurate models of the influence of these parameters on the probability of successful packet transmission, packet delay, and energy consumption are not available. Moreover, it is not clear how to adapt the parameters to the changes of the network and traffic regimes by algorithms that can run on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, a Markov chain is proposed to model these relations by simple expressions without giving up the accuracy. In contrast to previous work, the presence of limited number of retransmissions, acknowledgments, unsaturated traffic, packet size, and packet copying delay due to hardware limitations is accounted for. The model is then used to derive a distributed adaptive algorithm for minimizing the power consumption while guaranteeing a given successful packet reception probability and delay constraints in the packet transmission. The algorithm does not require any modification of the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control and can be easily implemented on network devices. The algorithm has been experimentally implemented and evaluated on a testbed with off-the-shelf wireless sensor devices. Experimental results show that the analysis is accurate, that the proposed algorithm satisfies reliability and delay constraints, and that the approach reduces the energy consumption of the network under both stationary and transient conditions. Specifically, even if the number of devices and traffic configuration change sharply, the proposed parallel and distributed algorithm allows the system to operate close to its optimal state by estimating the busy channel and channel access probabilities. Furthermore, results indicate that the protocol reacts promptly to errors in the estimation of the number of devices and in the traffic load that can appear due to device mobility. It is also shown that the effect of imperfect channel and carrier sensing on system performance heavily depends on the traffic load and limited range of the protocol parameters."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.159"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205745"",""IEEE 802.15.4";Markov chain model;"optimization"",""IEEE 802.15 Standards";Delay;Reliability;Markov processes;Protocols;Analytical models;"Optimization"","""",""114"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""29 May 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Modeling their propagation dynamics is essential to predict their potential damages and develop countermeasures. Although several analytical models have been proposed for modeling propagation dynamics of social network worms, there are two critical problems unsolved: temporal dynamics and spatial dependence. First, previous models have not taken into account the different time periods of Internet users checking emails or social messages, namely, temporal dynamics. Second, the problem of spatial dependence results from the improper assumption that the states of neighboring nodes are independent. These two problems seriously affect the accuracy of the previous analytical models. To address these two problems, we propose a novel analytical model. This model implements a spatial-temporal synchronization process, which is able to capture the temporal dynamics. Additionally, we find the essence of spatial dependence is the spreading cycles. By eliminating the effect of these cycles, our model overcomes the computational challenge of spatial dependence and provides a stronger approximation to the propagation dynamics. To evaluate our susceptible-infectious-immunized (SII) model, we conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. Compared with previous epidemic models and the spatial-temporal model, the experimental results show our SII model achieves a greater accuracy.

An optimization framework consisting of dynamic rate weight assignment, fair data rate allocation, and flow routing for the problem is proposed. To fairly allocate sensors with optimal data rates and efficiently route sensing data to the sink, we then introduce a weighted, fair data rate allocation and flow routing problem, subject to energy budgets of sensors.

Under the assumption of both limited bandwidth and node tunability, a total fixed bandwidth $(W)$ is equally split into $(c)$ channels with $(0<m\le c)$ interfaces equipped on each node for channel switching. The network contains totally $(n)$ nodes, each serving as a source with $(k)$ randomly and uniformly selected destinations. We try to give a comprehensive picture of multicast scalings by investigating both the static and mobile networks, with the metrics being capacity and delay. Previous literature has indicated that unicast capacity is solely determined by the ratio of channels to interfaces $(c/m)$ in MC-MR networks. However, in multicast our problem is made more complicated by the interplay among $(k)$, $(c/m)$ and node mobility (if considered in mobile scenario). We characterize their impact on multicast scaling and obtain three remarkable findings from our results. First, we find capacity loss exists in static networks even if the ratio $(c/m=O(\log n))$ (We use the following notation throughout our paper: $(f(n)=O(g(n))\Leftrightarrow \limsup _{n\rightarrow \infty }{f(n)\over g(n)} <\infty)$, $(f(n)=\Omega (g(n))\Leftrightarrow \liminf _{n\rightarrow \infty }{f(n)\over g(n)} <\infty)$, $(f(n)=\Theta (g(n))\Leftrightarrow f(n)=O(g(n)))$ and $(g(n)=O(f(n)))$, $(f(n)=\widetilde{\Theta }(\cdot ))$: The corresponding order $(\Theta (\cdot ))$ which contains a logarithmic order.) when $(k)$ is close to $(\Theta (n))$. This differs from unicast that is free of capacity loss as long as $(c/m=O(\log n))$. Second, mobility is manifested to improve multicast capacity in MC-MR networks, where two major capacity bottlenecks, i.e., connectivity and interference constraints, in static networks can be effectively broken. Third, a largely reduced delay is possible by simply seeking for multichannel reuse in 2-hop algorithm without redundancy. This even outperforms the delay scaling in single channel framework , where a delay smaller than $(\Theta (\sqrt{n\log k}))$ is not achievable even with more than $(\Theta (\sqrt{n\log k}))$ relay nodes involved in 2-hop mode. As a high-level summary of our results, our work discloses analytically where the performance improvement and degradation exhibit in MC-MR networks, meanwhile unifying the previous bounds on unicast (setting $(k=1)$) in ."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.334"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381403"",""Multicast";multichannel multiradio;"scaling"",""Multicast communication";Routing;Mobile communication;Upper bound;Mobile computing;Unicast;"Wireless networks"","""",""9"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""13 Dec 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Instead, with such a kind of information presumably known in advance, our goal is to efficiently stage the shared data items to predetermined sites at advocated time instants to align with the patterns while minimizing the monetary costs for caching and transmitting the requested data items. To this end, we follow the cost and network models in [1] and extend the analysis to multiple data items, each with single or multiple copies. Our results show that under homogeneous cost model, when the ratio of transmission cost and caching cost is low, a single copy of each data item can efficiently serve all the user requests. While in multicopy situation, we also consider the tradeoff between the transmission cost and caching cost by controlling the upper bounds of transmissions and copies.

The multicast capacity in our paper is defined as the maximum number of packets that can be disseminated from the source and successfully received by all multicast destinations. To explore the expected multicast capacity, we propose a framework for the joint optimization of both dynamic power control and error control. In our framework, the lossy wireless transmission links are characterized by the Rayleigh fading model, which reveals the realistic relationship among link quality, transmission power, and path attenuation. Under this model, we exploit the reliability gain of random linear network coding, also referred to as intrabatch coding in this paper, by disseminating data in batches. To maximize multicast capacity, another type of network coding opportunities across batches, referred to as interbatch coding, is also explored. Our analytical framework based on intrabatch and interbatch network coding eventually leads to a linear programming formulation that is proved to obtain the optimal multicast capacity. To approach the theoretical results in practice, we propose an algorithm called DMCC that exploits the intrabatch and interbatch coding via dynamically constructing bottleneck trees.

Modern applications are often collaborative in nature, with a distributed user base for input and output data sets. Processing such large input data typically involves copying (or staging) the data onto the supercomputer's specialized high-speed storage, scratch space, for sustained high I/O throughput. This copying is crucial as remotely accessing the data while an application executes results in unnecessary delays and consequently performance degradation. However, the current practice of conservatively staging data as early as possible makes the data vulnerable to storage failures, which may entail restaging and reduced job throughput. To address this, we present a timely staging framework that uses a combination of job start-up time predictions, user-specified volunteer or cloud-based intermediate storage nodes, and decentralized data delivery to coincide input data staging with job start-up. Evaluation of our approach using both PlanetLab and Azure cloud services, as well as simulations based on three years of Jaguar supercomputer (No. 3 in Top500) job logs show as much as 91.0 percent reduction in staging times compared to direct transfers, 75.2 percent reduction in wait time on scratch, and 2.4 percent reduction in usage/hour.

As the scale and complexity of MPSoC continuously increase, monitoring and mitigating reliability threats at runtime could offer better performance, scalability, and flexibility for MPSoC designs. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach, on-chip sensor network (SENoC), to collaboratively predict, detect, report, and alleviate runtime threats in MPSoC. SENoC not only detects reliability threats and shares related information among PUs, but also plans and coordinates the reactions of related PUs in MPSoC. SENoC is used to alleviate the impacts of simultaneous switching noise in MPSoC's P/G network during power gating. Based on the detailed noise behaviors under different scenarios derived by our circuit-level MPSoC P/G noise simulation and analysis platform, simulation results show that SENoC helps to achieve on average 26.2 percent performance improvement compared with the traditional stop-go method with 1.4 percent area overhead in an 8*8-core MPSoC in 45 nm.

Our pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application environment, the configuration of a multiserver system, the service-level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the penalty of a low-quality service, the cost of renting, the cost of energy consumption, and a service provider's margin and profit.

Sparse approximate inverse (SAI) preconditioners are a popular class of preconditioners designed to improve the condition number of large sparse matrices.

For every node pair in a full-mesh network with $(n)$ nodes, this paper presents a family of new approaches that efficiently identify an acceptable indirect path that has a similar to or even better performance than the direct path, hence considerably scaling the network at the cost of low per-node traffic overhead. In prior techniques, every node frequently incurs $(O(n^{1.5}))$ traffic overhead to probe the links from itself to all other nodes and to broadcast its probing results to a small set of nodes. In contrast, in our approaches, each node measures its links to only $(O(\sqrt{n}))$ other nodes and transmits the measuring results to $(O(\sqrt{n}))$ other nodes, where the two node sets of size $(O(\sqrt{n}))$ are determined by the partial sampling schemes presented in this paper. Mathematical analyses and trace-driven simulations show that our approaches dramatically reduce the per-node traffic overhead to $(O (n))$ while maintaining an acceptable backup path for each node pair with high probability. More precisely, our approaches, which are based on enhanced and rotational partial sampling schemes, are capable of increasing said probability to about 65 and 85 percent, respectively. For many network applications, this is sufficiently high such that the increased scalability outweighs such a drawback. In addition, it is not desirable to identify an outstanding backup path for every node pair in reality, due to the variable link quality."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.326"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365178"",""Partial sampling";overlay network;backup path;"scalability"",""Relays";Probes;Educational institutions;Routing;Scalability;"Internet"","""",""2"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""29 Nov 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Scalable priority queue implementation requires solutions to two fundamental problems. The first is to sort queue elements in real time at ever increasing line speeds (e.g., at OC-768 rates). The second is to store a huge number of packets (e.g., millions of packets). In this paper, we propose novel solutions by decomposing the problem into two parts, a succinct priority index (PI) in SRAM that can efficiently maintain a real-time sorting of priorities, coupled with a DRAM-based implementation of large packet buffers. In particular, we propose three related novel succinct PI data structures for implementing high-speed PIs: a PI, a counting priority index (CPI), and a pipelined counting priority index (pCPI). We show that all three structures can be very compactly implemented in SRAM using only ⊖(U) space, where U is the size of the universe required to implement the priority keys (time stamps). We also show that our proposed PI structures can be implemented very efficiently as well by leveraging hardware-optimized instructions that are readily available in modern 64-bit processors. The operations on the PI and CPI structures take ⊖(logW U) time complexity, where W is the processor word length (i.e., W = 64). Alternatively, operations on the pCPI structure take amortized constant time with only ⊖(logW U) pipeline stages (e.g., only four pipeline stages for U = 16 million). Finally, we show the application of our proposed PI structures for the scalable management of large packet buffers at line speeds.

Thus, this paper presents an exhaustive microbenchmark-based analysis of atomic additions in shared memory that quantifies the impact of access conflicts on latency and throughput. This analysis has led us to discover the lock mechanism that enables atomic updates to shared memory and to propose a performance model to estimate the latency penalties due to collisions by position or bank conflicts.

A distributed communication and storage protocol is then presented for situations where all mobile devices are within communication range of each other, and it is shown through testbed experiments and simulation that the protocol operates correctly and makes efficient use of storage space and communication bandwidth, while maximizing the longevity of stored data."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.84"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482562"",""Distributed storage";distributed systems;mobile ad hoc network (MANET);"mobile storage systems"",""Protocols";Mobile handsets;Wireless communication;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;"Mobile ad hoc networks"","""",""11"",""1"",""30"",""IEEE"",""20 Mar 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

In this work, we develop a system called POVA for traffic light sensing in large-scale urban areas. The system employs pervasive probe vehicles that just report real-time states of position and speed from time to time. POVA has advantages of wide coverage and low deployment cost. The important observation motivating the design of POVA is that a traffic light has a considerable impact on mobility of vehicles on the road attached to the traffic light. However, the system design faces three unique challenges: 1) Probe reports are by nature discrete while the goal of traffic light sensing is to determine the state of a traffic light at any time"; 2) there may be a very limited number of probe reports in a given duration for traffic light state estimation;" and 3) a traffic light may change its state with a variable interval. To tackle the challenges, we develop a new technique that makes the best use of limited probe reports as well as statistical features of light states. It first estimates the state of a traffic light at the time instant of a report by applying maximum a posterior estimation. Then, we formulate the state estimation of a light at any time into a joint optimization problem that is solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. We have implemented the system and tested it with a fleet of around 4,000 probe taxis and 2,000 buses in Shanghai, China. Trace-driven experimentation and field study show that nearly 60 percent of traffic lights have an estimation error lower than 19 percent if 20,000 probe vehicles would be employed in the urban area of Shanghai. We further demonstrate that the estimation error rate is as low as 18 percent even when the number of available reports is merely 1 per minute."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.233"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6255741"",""Traffic light sensing";probe vehicles;MAP;statistical features;taxi;"GPS traces"",""Vehicles";Probes;Sensors;Entropy;State estimation;"Roads"","""",""22"",""1"",""25"",""IEEE"",""31 Jul 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Declustering parallelizes the query retrieval process by distributing the data items requested by queries among several disks. Replication enables alternative disk choices for individual disk items and thus provides better query parallelism options. In general, existing replicated declustering schemes do not consider query log information and try to optimize all possible queries for a specific query type, such as range or spatial queries. In such schemes, it is assumed that two or more copies of all data items are to be generated and scheduling of these copies to disks are discussed. However, in some applications, generation of even two copies of all of the data items is not feasible, since data items tend to have very large sizes. In this work, we assume that there is a given limit on disk capacities and thus on replication amounts. We utilize existing query-log information to propose a selective replicated declustering scheme, in which we select the data items to be replicated and decide on their scheduling onto disks while respecting disk capacities. We propose and implement an iterative improvement algorithm to obtain a two-way replicated declustering and use this algorithm in a recursive framework to generate a multiway replicated declustering.

In this paper, we put forward a real-time tracking system RASS, which can achieve this goal and is promising in the applications like the safeguard system. Our basic idea is to divide the tracking field into different areas, with adjacent areas using different communication channels. So, the interference among different areas can be prevented. For each area, three communicating nodes are deployed on the ceiling as a regular triangle to monitor this area. In each triangle area, we use a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to locate the object. This model simulates the relationship between the signal dynamics caused by the object and the object position. It not only considers the ideal case of signal dynamics caused by the object, but also utilizes their irregular information. As a result, it can reach the tracking accuracy to around 1 m by just using three nodes in a triangle area with 4 m in each side. The experiments show that the tracking latency of the proposed RASS system is bounded by only about 0.26 m.

Existing reputation systems have two problems. First, they directly regard node reputation as trust. Rather, reputation represents the opinions formed by others about a node's QoS behavior, while trust represents a node's honesty and willingness to cooperate. In addition to trust, factors such as node capacity and lifetime also influence reputation. Due to these factors' heterogeneity and variance over time, reputation cannot directly reflect a node's trust or current QoS. Second, existing reputation systems guide a node to select the server with the highest reputation, which may not actually select the highest QoS server and would overload the highest reputed nodes. This work aims to accurately reflect node trust and provide guidance for high-QoS server selection. Through experimental study, we find that node trust, available capacity, and lifetime positively affect node reputation. Based on this observation, we first propose a manual trust model and an automatic trust model that remove the influence of additional factors on reputation to truly reflect node trust. We then propose a high-QoS server selection algorithm that separately considers node trust, current available capacity, and lifetime. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the trust models in accurate node trust reflection compared with an existing reputation system.

On the Internet with millions of flows, potentially millions of counters are required to be updated at wirespeed of 40 Gb/s and beyond. It is widely accepted that SRAM is too costly to store such large counter arrays entirely, and DRAM is too slow to catch up with the line rate. In this paper, we propose a DRAM-based architecture that takes advantage of the performance of modern commodity DRAM by interleaving counter updates to multiple memory banks. Our architecture is based on the observation that most flows on the Internet consist of multiple packets that are transmitted during a relatively short period of time, which are referred to as traffic bursts. Our proposed architecture makes use of a simple randomization scheme and a set of small fully associative request queues to statistically guarantee a near-perfect load balancing of counter updates to the memory banks. The architecture explores the benefit of traffic bursts to greatly reduce the maximum size of the request queues while providing a diminishing overflow probability guarantee. We also develop queuing models to show that as long as the flow sizes are heavy-tailed distributed due to traffic bursts, the maximum request queue length is always bounded by a small constant. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our queuing models.

However, accurate tracking of the location of mobile primary users is difficult due mainly to the CR-unique constraint, i.e., localization must rely solely on reported sensing results (i.e., measured primary signal strengths), which can easily be compromised by malicious sensors (or attackers). To cope with this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Sequential mOnte carLo combIned with shadow-faDing estimation (SOLID), for accurate, attack/fault-tolerant tracking of small-scale mobile primary users. The key idea underlying SOLID is to exploit the temporal shadow fading correlation in sensing results induced by the primary user's mobility. Specifically, SOLID augments conventional Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based target tracking with shadow-fading estimation. By examining the shadow-fading gain between the primary transmitter and CRs/sensors, SOLID 1) significantly improves the accuracy of primary tracking regardless of the presence/absence of attack, and 2) successfully masks the abnormal sensing reports due to sensor faults or attacks, preserving localization accuracy and improving spatial spectrum efficiency. Our extensive evaluation in realistic wireless fading environments shows that SOLID lowers localization error by up to 88 percent in the absence of attacks, and 89 percent in the presence of the challenging """"slow-poisoning” attack, compared to the conventional SMC-based tracking."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.191"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226377"",""Cognitive radio";mobile primary user;location tracking;security;log-normal shadowing;"Kalman filter"",""Sensors";Solids;Mobile communication;Fading;Transmitters;Estimation;"Wireless sensor networks"","""",""11"","""",""48"",""IEEE"",""26 Jun 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there have been wide privacy concerns as personal health information could be exposed to those third party servers and to unauthorized parties. To assure the patients' control over access to their own PHRs, it is a promising method to encrypt the PHRs before outsourcing. Yet, issues such as risks of privacy exposure, scalability in key management, flexible access, and efficient user revocation, have remained the most important challenges toward achieving fine-grained, cryptographically enforced data access control. In this paper, we propose a novel patient-centric framework and a suite of mechanisms for data access control to PHRs stored in semitrusted servers. To achieve fine-grained and scalable data access control for PHRs, we leverage attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques to encrypt each patient's PHR file. Different from previous works in secure data outsourcing, we focus on the multiple data owner scenario, and divide the users in the PHR system into multiple security domains that greatly reduces the key management complexity for owners and users. A high degree of patient privacy is guaranteed simultaneously by exploiting multiauthority ABE. Our scheme also enables dynamic modification of access policies or file attributes, supports efficient on-demand user/attribute revocation and break-glass access under emergency scenarios.

As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, $(k)$-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation. In addition, distributed computing is taken into account, and position of the hypercube is encoded by a few bits only using the bit operation. As a result, the new scheme is able to work successfully in any environment without human interventions. Finally, the experiments with a real WSN data set demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and robust."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.261"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295612"",""Wireless sensor networks";Training data;Monitoring;Real time systems;Detectors;Encoding;Complexity theory;parameter selection;Wireless sensor network;k-nearest neighbor;anomaly detection;"distributed computing"",""Wireless sensor networks";Training data;Monitoring;Real time systems;Detectors;Encoding;"Complexity theory"","""",""98"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""5 Sep 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;

Depending on which type of strategy is adopted in PhN, we design the optimal-throughput strategy for SaN.

In the proposed schedule, the energy consumed by sensor nodes for any traffic pattern is very close to the minimum required by their workloads given in the traffic pattern.

In this way, SOBAS provides an effective dynamic en-route filtering mechanism, where the malicious data is filtered from the network. With SOBAS, we are able to achieve our main goal of synchronizing events at the sink as quickly, as accurately, and as surreptitiously as possible. With loose synchronization, SOBAS reduces the number of control messages needed for a WSN to operate providing the key benefits of reduced energy consumption as well as reducing the opportunity for malicious nodes to eavesdrop, intercept, or be made aware of the presence of the network. Albeit a loose synchronization per se, SOBAS is also able to provide $(7.24 \mu)$s clock precision given today's sensor technology, which is much better than other comparable schemes (schemes that do not employ GPS devices). Also, we show that by recognizing the need for and employing loose time synchronization, necessary synchronization can be provided to the WSN application using half of the energy needed for traditional schemes.

Due to communication and computation constraints, it is infeasible for agents to directly interact with all other agents to form coalitions. Most previous coalition formation studies, however, overlooked this aspect. Those studies did not provide an explicitly modeled agent network or assumed that agents were in a fully connected network, where an agent can directly communicate with all other agents. Thus, to alleviate this problem, it is necessary to provide a neighborhood network structure, within which agents can directly interact only with their neighbors. Toward this end, in this paper, a self-adaptation-based dynamic coalition formation mechanism is proposed. The proposed mechanism operates in a neighborhood agent network. Based on self-adaptation principles, this mechanism enables agents to dynamically adjust their degrees of involvement in multiple coalitions and to join new coalitions at any time. The self-adaptation process, i.e., agents adjusting their degrees of involvement in multiple coalitions, is realized by exploiting a negotiation protocol. The proposed mechanism is evaluated through a comparison with a centralized mechanism (CM) and three other coalition formation mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of the entire network profit and time consumption. Additionally, a brief survey of current coalition formation research is also provided. From this survey, readers can have a general understanding of the focuses and progress of current research.

The first step focuses on using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to model and analyze the dynamic evolution of the service demand. Driven by the SDE model, expected future performance of a FSP system is analytically evaluated in the second step. Step three utilizes the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to identify near-optimal service-providing policies for each node.

Given the limited storage and energy resources of many DTN nodes, there is a tradeoff between maximizing delivery and minimizing storage and energy consumption. In this paper, we study the routing problem in DTN with limited resources. We formulate a mathematical model for optimal routing, assuming the presence of a global observer that can collect information about all the nodes in the network. Next, we propose a new protocol based on social grouping among the nodes to maximize data delivery while minimizing network overhead by efficiently spreading the packet copies in the network. We compare the new protocol with the optimal results and the existing well-known routing protocols using real life simulations. Results show that the proposed protocol achieves higher delivery ratio and less average delay compared to other protocols with significant reduction in network overhead."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.235"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261310"",""Delay tolerant networks";routing protocols;"social grouping"",""Routing protocols";Delays;Fault tolerant systems;Receivers;"Social network services"","""",""59"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

In particular, we develop online dynamic provisioning solutions with and without future workload information available. We first reveal an elegant structure of the offline dynamic provisioning problem, which allows us to characterize the optimal solution in a “divide-andconquer” manner. We then exploit this insight to design two online algorithms with competitive ratios 2 - α and e/(e - 1 + α), respectively, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is the normalized size of a look-ahead window in which future workload information is available. A fundamental observation is that future workload information beyond the full-size look-ahead window (corresponding to α = 1) will not improve dynamic provisioning performance.

We consider three schemes that represent well the spectrum of behavior-shaped content storage strategies: the selfish, the self-aware cooperative, and the optimally altruistic ones. Our study shows that when the social group is tight (high degree of similarity), the optimally altruistic behavior yields the best performance for both the entire group (by definition) and the individual nodes (contrary to typical expectations). When the group is made up of members with almost no similarity, altruism or cooperation cannot bring much benefit to either the group or the individuals and thus, selfish behavior emerges as the preferable choice due to its simplicity. Notably, from a theoretical point of view, our “similarity favors cooperation” argument is inline with sociological interpretations of human altruistic behavior.

However, through the analysis of AP usage based on a real WLAN trace of one-month collected at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), we find that such an assumption does not hold. In fact, due to users' social activities which is particularly time for enterprise environments, they tend to arrive or leave in unison, which would disruptively affect the load balance among APs. In this paper, we propose a novel AP allocation scheme to tackle the load balancing problem in WLANs, taking into account the social relationships of users. In this scheme, users with intense social relationships are assigned to different APs so that jointly departure of those users would have minor impact on the load balance of APs. Given that the problem of allocating an AP for each user so that the average of the sums of social relation intensity between any pair of users in each AP is NP-complete, we propose an online greedy algorithm.

However, such approaches have focused on identifying optimal resource utilization for one programming model, either shared memory or message passing, in isolation. The potential solution space, thus the challenge, increases substantially when optimizing hybrid models since the possible resource configurations increase exponentially. Nonetheless, with the accelerating adoption of hybrid programming models, we increasingly need improved energy efficiency in hybrid parallel applications on large-scale systems.

Many application scientists have initiated efforts to integrate data-intensive computing into computational-intensive HPC facilities, particularly for data analytics. We have observed several scientific applications which must migrate their data from an HPC storage system to a data-intensive one for analytics. There is a gap between the data semantics of HPC storage and data-intensive system, hence, once migrated, the data must be further refined and reorganized. This reorganization must be performed before existing data-intensive tools such as MapReduce can be used to analyze data. This reorganization requires at least two complete scans through the data set and then at least one MapReduce program to prepare the data before analyzing it. Running multiple MapReduce phases causes significant overhead for the application, in the form of excessive I/O operations. That is for every MapReduce phase, a distributed read and write operation on the file system must be performed. Our contribution is to develop a MapReduce-based framework for HPC analytics to eliminate the multiple scans and also reduce the number of data preprocessing MapReduce programs. We also implement a data-centric scheduler to further improve the performance of HPC analytics MapReduce programs by maintaining the data locality. We have added additional expressiveness to the MapReduce language to allow application scientists to specify the logical semantics of their data such that 1) the data can be analyzed without running multiple data preprocessing MapReduce programs, and 2) the data can be simultaneously reorganized as it is migrated to the data-intensive file system.

However, hardware capabilities on their own are insufficient and must be paired with other logic to decide if, when, and by how much to apply energy-minimizing techniques while still meeting performance goals.

Since the two manipulated variables, task rates and processor frequencies, contribute to the CPU utilizations together with strong coupling, adjusting them asynchronously may degrade the utilization control performance.

To achieve dependable resources with the least access time to execute tasks in undependable MAS-SN, this paper presents a novel task allocation model based on the negotiation reputation mechanism, where an agent's past behaviors in the resource negotiation of task execution can influence its probability to be allocated new tasks in the future. In this model, the agent that contributes more dependable resources with less access time during task execution is rewarded with a higher negotiation reputation, and may receive preferential allocation of new tasks. Through experiments, we determine that our task allocation model is superior to the traditional resources-based allocation approaches and game theory-based allocation approaches in terms of both the task allocation success rate and task execution time and that it usually performs close to the ideal approach (in which deceptive agents are fully detected) in terms of task execution time."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.249"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6287504"",""Resource management";Social network services;Multiagent systems;Game theory;History;Load management;Computer architecture;deceptive agents;Social networks;multiagent systems;task allocation;load balancing;"undependable"",""Resource management";Social network services;Multiagent systems;Game theory;History;Load management;"Computer architecture"","""",""54"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""27 Aug 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;

In terrestrial environment, it is assumed that a Rician flat fading model should be used because there exists line of sight. In underwater environment, we apply a modified UWB Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) model to characterize the underwater acoustic fading channel. We propose the TDoA finding algorithm via estimating the delay of two correlated channels, and compare it with the existing approach.

Unfortunately, MPC controllers rely on a priori knowledge of thermal models and their complexity exponentially grows with the number of controlled cores. In this paper, we present a scalable, fully distributed, energy-aware thermal management solution for single-chip multicore platforms.

Locally, each node selects the optimal frequency to meet temperature constraints while minimizing the performance penalty and system energy. Comparable performance with state-of-the-art MPC controllers is achieved by letting controllers exchange a limited amount of information at runtime on a neighborhood basis.

TA service provides tunable visibility of state of the VSP's network leading to better VPN performance. A key challenge of the TA service is to generate TA with relevant network resource information for each VPN in an accurate and fair manner.

Then, the topology of 3D NoC becomes a Nonstationary Irregular Mesh (NSI-Mesh). To ensure the successful packet delivery in the NSI-Mesh, some routing algorithms had been proposed in the previous works. However, the network still suffers from extremely traffic imbalance among lateral and vertical logic layer. In this paper, we propose a Topology Aware Adaptive Routing (TAAR) to balance the traffic load for NSI-Mesh in 3D NoC. TAAR has three routing modes, which can be dynamically adjusted based on the topology status of the routing path. In addition to increasing routing flexibility, the TAAR also increases both vertical and lateral path diversity to balance the traffic load. Compared with the related adaptive routing methods, the experimental results show that the proposed TAAR can reduce 19 to 295 percent traffic loads in the bottom logic layer and improve around 7.7 to 380 percent network throughput.

To achieve improved energy efficiency, request batching can be conducted to group received requests into batches and put the processor into sleep between the batches. However, it is challenging to perform request batching on a virtualized server because different virtual machines on the same server may have different workload intensities. Hence, putting the shared processor into sleep may severely impact the application performance of all the virtual machines. This paper proposes Virtual Batching, a novel request batching solution for virtualized servers with primarily light workloads. Our solution dynamically allocates CPU resources such that all the virtual machines can have approximately the same performance level relative to their allowed peak values. Based on this uniform level, Virtual Batching determines the time length for periodically batching incoming requests and putting the processor into sleep. When the workload intensity changes from light to moderate, request batching is automatically switched to DVFS to increase processor frequency for performance guarantees. Virtual Batching is also extended to integrate with server consolidation for maximized energy conservation with performance guarantees for virtualized data centers. Empirical results based on a hardware testbed and real trace files show that Virtual Batching can achieve the desired performance with more energy conservation than several well-designed baselines, e.g., 63 percent more, on average, than a solution based on DVFS only."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.237"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263244"",""Servers";Time factors;Virtual machining;Memory management;Energy consumption;Switches;Energy conservation;control theory;Energy management;virtual machines;request batching;servers;"data centers"",""Servers";Time factors;Virtual machining;Memory management;Energy consumption;Switches;"Energy conservation"","""",""13"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""8 Aug 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;
