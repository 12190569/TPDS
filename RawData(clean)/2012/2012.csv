Since large numbers of applications only require approximate aggregation results rather than the exact ones, some approximate aggregation algorithms have been proposed to save energy. However, the error bounds of these algorithms are fixed and it is impossible to adjust the error bounds automatically, so they cannot meet the requirement of arbitrary precision required by various users. Thus, a uniform sampling-based algorithm was proposed by the authors of this paper to satisfy arbitrary precision requirement. Unfortunately, this uniform sampling-based algorithm is only suitable for static sensor networks. To overcome the shortcoming of the uniform sampling-based algorithm, this paper proposes four Bernoulli sampling-based and distributed approximate aggregation algorithms to process the snapshot and continuous aggregation queries in dynamic sensor networks.

Second, we develop a realistic adversary model, assuming that the adversary can monitor the network traffic in multiple areas, rather than the entire network or only one area. Using this model, we introduce a novel attack called Hotspot-Locating where the adversary uses traffic analysis techniques to locate hotspots. Finally, we propose a cloud-based scheme for efficiently protecting source nodes' location privacy against Hotspot-Locating attack by creating a cloud with an irregular shape of fake traffic, to counteract the inconsistency in the traffic pattern and camouflage the source node in the nodes forming the cloud. To reduce the energy cost, clouds are active only during data transmission and the intersection of clouds creates a larger merged cloud, to reduce the number of fake packets and also boost privacy preservation.

Differently from previous work, our framework is aimed at characterizing the exact distribution of relevant performance metrics, which is a substantial improvement over existing studies characterizing either the expected value of the metric, or an asymptotic approximation of the actual distribution. In particular, the considered performance metrics are packet delivery delay, and communication cost, expressed as number of copies of a packet circulating in the network at the time of delivery. Our proposed framework is based on a characterization of the routing process as a stochastic coloring process and can be applied to model performance of most stateless delay tolerant routing protocols, such as epidemic, two-hops, and spray and wait. After introducing the framework, we present examples of its application to derive the packet delivery delay and communication cost distribution of two such protocols, namely epidemic and two-hops routing. Characterizing packet delivery delay and communication cost distribution is important to investigate fundamental properties of delay tolerant networks. As an example, we show how packet delivery delay distribution can be used to estimate how epidemic routing performance changes in presence of different degrees of node cooperation within the network. More specifically, we consider fully cooperative, noncooperative, and probabilistic cooperative scenarios, and derive nearly exact expressions of the packet delivery rate (PDR) under these scenarios based on our proposed framework. The comparison of the obtained packet delivery rate estimation in the various cooperation scenarios suggests that even a modest level of node cooperation (probabilistic cooperation with a low probability of cooperation) is sufficient to achieve 2-fold performance improvement with respect to the most pessimistic scenario in which all potential forwarders drop packets."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.99"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740860"",""Delay-tolerant networks";noncooperative networks;delay-tolerant routing;packet delivery delay distribution;"communication cost distribution."",""Delay";Routing;Routing protocols;Random variables;Estimation;"Approximation methods"","""",""32"","""",""19"",""IEEE"",""5 Apr 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In emerging cyber-physical systems, where there can be a large number of users searching information directly into the physical world, many new challenges arise for top-k query processing. From the client's perspective, users may request different sets of information, with different priorities and at different times. Thus, top-k search should not only be multidimensional, but also be across time domain. From the system's perspective, data collection is usually carried out by small sensing devices. Unlike the data centers used for searching in the cyber-space, these devices are often extremely resource constrained and system efficiency is of paramount importance. In this paper, we develop a framework that can effectively satisfy demands from the two aspects. The sensor network maintains an efficient dominant graph data structure for data readings. A simple top-k extraction algorithm is used for user query processing and two schemes are proposed to further reduce communication cost. Our methods can be used for top-k query with any linear convex query function. The framework is adaptive enough to incorporate some advanced features";" for example, we show how approximate queries and data aging can be applied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for continuous multidimensional top-k query processing in sensor networks.

In NCECD, videos are divided into segments that are then further divided into blocks. These blocks are encoded into independent blocks that are distributed to different peers for local storage. With NCECD, a new client only needs to connect to a sufficient number of parent peers to be able to view the whole video and rarely needs to find new parents when performing random access operations. In most existing methods, a new client must search for parent peers containing specific segments";" however, NCECD uses the properties of network coding to cache equivalent content in peers, so that one can pick any parent without additional searches.

To remedy the RSS limitation, Intel's Ethernet Flow Director technology has been introduced. However, our analysis shows that Flow Director can cause significant packet reordering.

The key idea of our data collection approach ADC (Approximate Data Collection) is to divide a sensor network into clusters, discover local data correlations on each cluster head, and perform global approximate data collection on the sink node according to model parameters uploaded by cluster heads. Specifically, we propose a local estimation model to approximate the readings of sensor nodes in subsets, and prove rated error-bounds of data collection using this model. In the process of model-based data collection, we formulate the problem of selecting the minimum subset of sensor nodes into a minimum dominating set problem which is known to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm to find an approximate solution.

In this work, we propose a new approach suitable for on-chip networks capable of managing multidestination traffic via hardware in an efficient way with negligible complexity. We introduce a novel multicast routing mechanism, able to circumvent many of the limitations of conventional multicast schemes. Adaptive-tree multicasting is able to maintain correctness for multiflit multicast messages without routing restrictions, while also coupling correctness and performance in a natural way. Replication restrictions not only guarantee the presence of enough resources to avoid deadlock, but also dynamically adapt tree shape to network conditions, routing multicast messages through noncongested paths. The performance results, using a state-of-the-art full system simulation framework, show that it improves the average full system performance of a CMP by 20 percent and network ED2P by 15 percent, when compared to a state-of-the-art router with conventional multicast support and similar implementation cost."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.45"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143925"",""Chip multiprocessor (CMP)";multicast and broadcast communications;network-on-chip;"router microarchitecture"",""Routing";System recovery;Unicast;Proposals;Protocols;Hardware;"Vectors"","""",""3"","""",""50"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

While developing distributed generation (DG) tends to alleviate the traditional congestion problem, employing information and communications technology (ICT) helps manage DG more effectively. ICT involves a vast amount of data to facilitate a broader knowledge of the network status. Data computation and communications are critical elements that can impact the system performance. In this paper, we consider congestion caused by power surpluses produced from households' solar units on rooftops or on ground. Disconnecting some solar units is required to maintain the reliability of the distribution grid.

Only two virtual channels are required. One channel is applied in the deadlock-free routing algorithm for the mesh subnetwork based on a known base routing scheme, such as, negative-first or dimension-order routing. The other channel is similar to an adaptive channel. This combination presents a novel fully adaptive minimal routing scheme because the first channel does not supply routing paths for every source-destination pair. Other two algorithms named flow controlled clue and wormhole clue are proposed. Flow controlled clue is proposed for VCT-switched tori, which is fully adaptive minimal deadlock-free with no virtual channel. Each input port requires at least two buffers, each of which is able to keep a packet. A simple but well-designed flow control function is used in the proposed flow controlled clue routing algorithm to avoid deadlocks. Wormhole clue is proposed for wormhole-switched tori.

To deal with this issue, researchers have investigated routing based on the prediction of future contacts, taking advantage of nodes' mobility history. However, most of the previous work focused on the prediction of whether two nodes would have a contact, without considering the time of the contact. This paper proposes predict and relay (PER), an efficient routing algorithm for DTNs, where nodes determine the probability distribution of future contact times and choose a proper next-hop in order to improve the end-to-end delivery probability. The algorithm is based on two observations: one is that nodes usually move around a set of well-visited landmark points instead of moving randomly";" the other is that node mobility behavior is semi-deterministic and could be predicted once there is sufficient mobility history information. Specifically, our approach employs a time-homogeneous semi-Markov process model that describes node mobility as transitions between landmarks. Then, we extend it to handle the scenario where we consider the transition time between two landmarks. A simulation study shows that this approach improves the delivery ratio and also reduces the delivery latency compared to traditional DTN routing schemes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.140"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765946"",""Disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs)";landmarks;time-related Markov model;prediction;"routing."",""Routing";Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Predictive models;Relays;"History"","""",""103"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""12 May 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Techniques such as sensor node parameter tuning enable WSN designers to specialize tunable parameters (i.e., processor voltage and frequency, sensing frequency, etc.) to meet these application requirements.

This limitation motivated this paper which applies strategies to support the online prediction of application behavior in order to optimize data access operations on distributed systems, without requiring any information on past executions.

This paper describes the architecture, design, and implementation of CloudView, and how the proposed framework leverages the parallel computing capability of a computing cloud based on a large-scale distributed batch processing infrastructure that is built of commodity hardware. A case-based reasoning (CBR) approach is adopted for machine fault prediction, where the past cases of failure from a large number of machines are collected in a cloud. A case-base of past cases of failure is created using the global information obtained from a large number of machines. CloudView facilitates organization of sensor data and creation of case-base with global information. Case-base creation jobs are formulated using the MapReduce parallel data processing model. CloudView captures the failure cases across a large number of machines and shares the failure information with a number of local nodes in the form of case-base updates that occur in a time scale of every few hours. At local nodes, the real-time sensor data from a group of machines in the same facility/plant is continuously matched to the cases from the case-base for predicting the incipient faults-this local processing takes a much shorter time of a few seconds. The case-base is updated regularly (in the time scale of a few hours) on the cloud to include new cases of failure, and these case-base updates are pushed from CloudView to the local nodes. Experimental measurements show that fault predictions can be done in real-time (on a timescale of seconds) at the local nodes and massive machine data analysis for case-base creation and updating can be done on a timescale of minutes in the cloud. Our approach, in addition to being the first reported use of the cloud architecture for maintenance data storage, processing and analysis, also evaluates several possible cloud-based architectures that leverage the advantages of the parallel computing capabilities of the cloud to make local decisions with global information efficiently, while avoiding potential data bottlenecks that can occur in getting the maintenance data in and out of the cloud."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.306"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104038"",""Fault prediction";machine data analysis;case-based reasoning;cloud computing;Hadoop;"MapReduce"",""Sensors";Real time systems;Data analysis;Reliability;Cloud computing;Wind turbines;"Maintenance engineering"","""",""66"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""13 Dec 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose BloomCast, an efficient and effective full-text retrieval scheme, in unstructured P2P networks. By leveraging a hybrid P2P protocol, BloomCast replicates the items uniformly at random across the P2P networks, achieving a guaranteed recall at a communication cost of O(√N), where N is the size of the network. Furthermore, by casting Bloom Filters instead of the raw documents across the network, BloomCast significantly reduces the communication and storage costs for replication. We demonstrate the power of BloomCast design through both mathematical proof and comprehensive simulations based on the query logs from a major commercial search engine and NIST TREC WT10G data collection.

Previously, the study of data collection capacity has concentrated on large-scale random networks. However, in most of the practical sensor applications, the sensor network is not uniformly deployed and the number of sensors may not be as huge as in theory. Therefore, it is necessary to study the capacity of data collection in an arbitrary network. In this paper, we first derive the upper and lower bounds for data collection capacity in arbitrary networks under protocol interference and disk graph models. We show that a simple BFS tree-based method can lead to order-optimal performance for any arbitrary sensor networks. We then study the capacity bounds of data collection under a general graph model, where two nearby nodes may be unable to communicate due to barriers or path fading, and discuss performance implications.

Applications that involve heavy I/O activities, which are common in the cloud, probably benefit the most from caching. The use of local volatile memory as cache might be a natural alternative, but many well-known restrictions, such as capacity and the utilization of host machines, hinder its effective use. In addition to technical challenges, providing cache services in clouds encounters a major practical issue (quality of service or service level agreement issue) of pricing. Currently, (public) cloud users are limited to a small set of uniform and coarse-grained service offerings, such as High-Memory and High-CPU in Amazon EC2. In this paper, we present the cache as a service (CaaS) model as an optional service to typical infrastructure service offerings. Specifically, the cloud provider sets aside a large pool of memory that can be dynamically partitioned and allocated to standard infrastructure services as disk cache. We first investigate the feasibility of providing CaaS with the proof-of-concept elastic cache system (using dedicated remote memory servers) built and validated on the actual system, and practical benefits of CaaS for both users and providers (i.e., performance and profit, respectively) are thoroughly studied with a novel pricing scheme. Our CaaS model helps to leverage the cloud economy greatly in that 1) the extra user cost for I/O performance gain is minimal if ever exists, and 2) the provider's profit increases due to improvements in server consolidation resulting from that performance gain. Through extensive experiments with eight resource allocation strategies, we demonstrate that our CaaS model can be a promising cost-efficient solution for both users and providers."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.297"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095538"",""Cloud computing";cache as a service;remote memory;"cost efficiency."",""Servers";Performance evaluation;Pricing;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Resource management;"Hardware"","""",""27"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""6 Dec 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

For chip multiprocessors (CMPs), data access latency depends on the organization of the memory hierarchy, the on-chip interconnect, and the running workload. Several network-on-chip (NoC) designs exploit communication locality to reduce communication latency by configuring special fast paths or circuits on which communication is faster than the rest of the NoC. However, communication patterns are directly affected by the cache organization and many cache organizations are designed in isolation of the underlying NoC or assume a simple NoC design, thus possibly missing optimization opportunities. In this work, we take a codesign approach of the NoC and cache organization. First, we propose a hybrid circuit/packet-switched NoC that exploits communication locality through periodic configuration of the most beneficial circuits. Second, we design a Unique Private (UP) caching scheme targeting the class of interconnects which exploit communication locality to improve communication latency. The Unique Private cache stores the data that are mostly accessed by each processor core in the core's locally accessible cache bank, while leveraging dedicated high-speed circuits in the interconnect to provide remote cores with fast access to shared data. Simulations of a suite of scientific and commercial workloads show that our proposed design achieves a speedup of 15.2 and 14 percent on a 16-core and a 64-core CMP, respectively, over the state-of-the-art NoC-Cache codesigned system that also exploits communication locality in multithreaded applications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.238"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030871"",""Multicore/single-chip multiprocessors";circuit-switching networks;"cache memories."",""Integrated circuit interconnections";Organizations;Routing;Switching circuits;Distributed databases;System-on-a-chip;"Cache memory"","""",""11"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""29 Sep 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Much previous work has focused on improving the design of on-chip networks but without more fully taking into consideration the on-chip communication behavior of application workloads that can be exploited by the network design. A significant portion of this paper analyzes and models on-chip network traffic characteristics of representative application workloads. Leveraged by this, the notion of globally coordinated on-chip networks is proposed in which application communication behavior-captured by traffic profiling-is utilized in the design and configuration of on-chip networks so as to support prevailing traffic flows well, in a globally coordinated manner. This is applied to the design of a hybrid network consisting of a mesh augmented with configurable multidrop (bus-like) spanning channels that serve as express paths for traffic flows benefiting from them, according to the characterized traffic profile.

In this diagnosis model, a set of tasks is assigned to pairs of nodes and their outcomes are compared by neighboring nodes. Given that comparisons are performed by the nodes themselves, faulty nodes can incorrectly claim that fault-free nodes are faulty or that faulty ones are fault-free. The collections of all agreements and disagreements, i.e., the comparison outcomes, among the nodes are used to identify the set of permanently faulty nodes. Since the introduction of the comparison model, significant progress has been made in both theory and practice associated with the original model and its offshoots. Nevertheless, the problem of efficiently identifying the set of faulty nodes when not all the comparison outcomes are available to the diagnosis algorithm at the beginning of the diagnosis phase, i.e., partial syndromes, remains an outstanding research issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel diagnosis approach using neural networks to solve this fault identification problem using partial syndromes.

The proposed experimental compiler framework employs novel compilation techniques to discover and represent multithreaded memory access patterns (MMAPs). At runtime, symbolic MMAPs are resolved and used by a partitioning algorithm to choose a partition of allocated memory blocks among the forked threads in the analyzed application. This partition is used to enforce data ownership by associating the data with the core that executes the thread owning the data. Based on the partition, the communication pattern of the application can be extracted. We demonstrate how this information can be used in an experimental architecture to accelerate applications. In particular, our compiler assisted data partitioning approach shows a 20 percent speedup over shared caching and 5 percent speedup over the closest runtime approximation, first touch. By leveraging the communication pattern we can achieve a comparable performance to a system that uses a complex centralized network configuration system at runtime.

Most of geographic forwarding protocols assume that all sensors are always on (or active) during forwarding. However, such an assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications where sensors are switched on or off (or inactive). In this paper, we describe our cover-sense-inform (CSI) framework for k-covered WSNs, where each point in a sensor field is covered by at least k active sensors. In CSI, k-coverage, sensor scheduling, and data forwarding are jointly considered. Based on our previous work on connected k-coverage [3], we propose the first design of geographic forwarding protocols for duty-cycled k-covered WSNs with and without data aggregation.

[3], [7], [18], [19], [20] proposed to refer to a dynamic group of vehicles whose excess computing, sensing, communication, and storage resources can be coordinated and dynamically allocated to authorized users, as a vehicular cloud. One of the characteristics that distinguishes vehicular clouds from conventional clouds is the dynamically changing amount of available resources that, in some cases, may fluctuate rather abruptly. In this work, we envision a vehicular cloud involving cars in the long-term parking lot of a typical international airport. The patrons of such a parking lot are typically on travel for several days, providing a pool of cars that can serve as the basis for a datacenter at the airport. We anticipate a park and plug scenario where the cars that participate in the vehicular cloud are plugged into a standard power outlet and are provided Ethernet connection to a central server at the airport. In order to be able to schedule resources and to assign computational tasks to the various cars in the vehicular cloud, a fundamental prerequisite is to have an accurate picture of the number of vehicles that are expected to be present in the parking lot as a function of time. What makes the problem difficult is the time-varying nature of the arrival and departure rates. In this work, we concern ourselves with predicting the parking occupancy given time-varying arrival and departure rates. Our main contribution is to provide closed forms for the probability distribution of the parking lot occupancy as a function of time, for the expected number of cars in the parking lot and its variance, and for the limiting behavior of these parameters as time increases.

The level of clock accuracy is depreciated with respect to time in order to account for long delays between contact opportunities.

In this paper, we redesign the RN pattern to make the collided RNs decodable. By leveraging the collision slots, the system performance can be dramatically enhanced. This novel scheme is called DDC, which is able to directly decode the collisions without exact knowledge of collided RNs.

For high performance parallel applications independent I/O is critical, particularly if checkpointing data are dynamically created or irregularly partitioned. In particular, parallel programs generating a large number of unrelated I/O accesses on large-scale systems often face serious I/O serializations introduced by lock contention and conflicts at file system layer.

We first study the root causes of 74 real-world concurrency bugs to understand what types of synchronization assumptions are violated in real world. This study reveals two classes of synchronization intentions that are common, frequently violated, and understudied-single-variable atomicity intention and multivariable correlation intention. Following this study, two bug detection tools, AVIO and MUVI, are proposed to automatically infer these two types of synchronization intentions and detect related bugs. Specifically, AVIO automatically extracts access interleaving invariants and detects a variety of atomicity-violations during production runs. It can work both with and without special hardware support in our implementation. MUVI automatically infers multivariable correlations through static analysis and detects multivariable concurrency bugs. Our evaluation with real-world large multithreaded applications shows that AVIO can detect more atomicity-violation bugs with 15 times fewer false positives on average than previous solutions. Besides, AVIO-H incurs negligible (0.4-0.5 percent) overhead. MUVI successfully extracts 6,449 access correlations from Linux, Mozilla, MySQL, and PostgreSQL with high (83 percent) accuracy.

A hierarchical support vector machines (H-SVM) scheme is proposed with the following advantages. First, H-SVM offers an efficient evaluation procedure in a distributed manner due to hierarchical structure. Second, H-SVM could determine these parameters based only on simpler network information, e.g., the hop counts, without requiring particular ranging hardware. Third, the exact mean and the variance of the estimation error introduced by H-SVM are derived which are seldom addressed in previous works.

In evidence propagation, we first perform evidence collection in these subtrees concurrently. Then, the partially updated subtrees exchange data for junction tree merging, so that all the cliques in the junction tree can be fully updated for evidence collection. Finally, evidence distribution is performed in all the subtrees to complete evidence propagation. Since merging subtrees requires communication across processors, we propose a technique called bitmap partitioning to explore the tradeoff between bandwidth utilization efficiency and the overhead due to the startup latency of message passing.

In this algorithm, the beacon trajectory is defined as the track of Depth-First Traversal (DFT) of the network graph, thus deterministic. The mobile beacon performs DFT dynamically, under the instruction of nearby sensors on the fly. It moves from sensor to sensor in an intelligent heuristic manner according to Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based distance measurements. We prove that DREAMS guarantees full localization (every sensor is localized) when the measurements are noise-free, and derive the upper bound of beacon total moving distance in this case. Then, we suggest to apply node elimination and Local Minimum Spanning Tree (LMST) to shorten beacon tour and reduce delay. Further, we extend DREAMS to multibeacon scenarios. Beacons with different coordinate systems compete for localizing sensors. Loser beacons agree on winner beacons' coordinate system, and become cooperative in subsequent localization. All sensors are finally localized in a commonly agreed coordinate systems. Through simulation we show that DREAMS guarantees full localization even with noisy distance measurements.

Existing energy conservation techniques are inadequate to achieve high energy efficiency for streaming media computing environments due to high data migration overhead. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a new energy-efficient method called Explicit Energy Saving Disk Cooling or EESDC. EESDC significantly reduces data migration overhead because of two reasons. First, a set of disks referred to Explicit Energy Saving Disks (EESD) is explicitly fixed according to temporal system load. Second, all the migrated data in EESDC directly contribute on extending the idle time of EESD to conserve more energy efficiently. Therefore, the EESDC method is conducive to saving more energy by quickly achieving energy-efficient data layouts without unnecessary data migrations. We implement EESDC in a simulated disk system, which is validated against a prototype system powered by our EESDC. Our experimental results using both real-world traces and synthetic traces show that EESDC can save up to 28.13-29.33 percent energy consumption for typical streaming media traces.

Our proposal deploys a dedicated G-line-based network to allow for fast and efficient signaling of barrier arrival and departure.

Of great importance to RFID applications in production economics is misplaced-tag pinpointing (MTP), because misplacement errors fail optimal inventory placement and thus significantly decrease profit. The existing MTP solution [1], originally proposed from a data-processing perspective, collects and processes a large amount of data. It suffers from time inefficiency (and energy-inefficiency as well if active tags are in use). The problem of finding efficient solutions for the MTP problem from the communication protocol design perspective has never been investigated before. In this paper, we propose a series of protocols toward efficient MTP solutions in large RFID systems. The proposed protocols detect misplaced tags using reader positions instead of tag positions to guarantee the efficiency and scalability as system scale grows, because RFID readers are much fewer than tags. Considering applications that employ active tags, we further propose a solution requiring responses from only a subset of tags in favor of energy saving. We also design a distributed protocol that enables each reader to independently detect misplaced tags. We then investigate how to apply the proposed protocols in scenarios with tag mobility. To evaluate the proposed protocols, we analyze their optimal performances to demonstrate their efficiency potential and also conduct extensive simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed protocols can significantly increase the time efficiency and the energy efficiency by over 70 percent on average when compared with the best existing work."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.48"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143928"",""RFID";misplaced-tag pinpointing;time-efficient;energy-efficient;"distributed protocol"",""Protocols";Radiofrequency identification;Vectors;Layout;Rail to rail inputs;Estimation;"Support vector machine classification"","""",""36"","""",""35"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

Second, we design a model-independent fuzzy controller for bounding an important performance metric, the 90th-percentile response time of requests flowing through the multitier architecture.

Although traditional searchable encryption techniques allow users to securely search over encrypted data through keywords, they support only Boolean search and are not yet sufficient to meet the effective data utilization need that is inherently demanded by large number of users and huge amount of data files in cloud. In this paper, we define and solve the problem of secure ranked keyword search over encrypted cloud data. Ranked search greatly enhances system usability by enabling search result relevance ranking instead of sending undifferentiated results, and further ensures the file retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we explore the statistical measure approach, i.e., relevance score, from information retrieval to build a secure searchable index, and develop a one-to-many order-preserving mapping technique to properly protect those sensitive score information. The resulting design is able to facilitate efficient server-side ranking without losing keyword privacy.

We show that the asynchronous network exceeds any regionally synchronous network in the coverage intensity, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the event capture, though the opportunities for coordinated sleep decreases as the synchronization region gets smaller.

P2P locality has, therefore, been widely suggested to mitigate the costly inter-ISP traffic. In this paper, we for the first time examine the existence and distribution of the locality through a large-scale hybrid PlanetLab-Internet measurement. We find that even in the most popular Autonomous Systems (ASes), very few individual torrents are able to form large enough local clusters of peers, making state-of-the-art locality mechanisms for individual torrents quite inefficient. Inspired by peers' multiple torrent behavior, we develop a novel framework that traces and recovers the available contents at peers across multiple torrents, and thus effectively amplifies the possibilities of local sharing. We address the key design issues in this framework, in particular, the detection of peer migration across the torrents. We develop a smart detection mechanism with shared trackers, which achieves 45 percent success rate without any tracker-level communication overhead. We further demonstrate strong evidence that the migrations are not random, but follow certain patterns with correlations. This leads to torrent clustering, a practical enhancement that can increase the detection rate to 75 percent, thus greatly facilitating locality across multiple torrents. The simulation results indicate that our framework can successfully reduce the cross-ISP traffic and minimize the possible degradation of peers' downloading experiences."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.253"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035701"",""BitTorrent";traffic locality;"measurement."",""Peer to peer computing";Extraterrestrial measurements;Internet;Availability;Educational institutions;Collaboration;"Particle measurements"","""",""6"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""6 Oct 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At the same time, content providers of P2P-VoD services also need to make sure that the service is operated with a manageable operating cost. Given the volume-based charging model by ISPs, P2P-VoD content providers would like to reduce peers' access to the content server so as to reduce the operating cost. In this paper, we address an important open problem: what is the “optimal replication ratio” in a P2P-VoD system such that peers will receive service from each other and at the same time, reduce the access to the content server? We address two fundamental issues: 1) what is the optimal replication ratio of a movie if we know its popularity, and 2) how to achieve these optimal ratios in a distributed and dynamic fashion. We first formally show how movie popularities can impact server's workload, and formulate the video replication as an optimization problem. We show that the conventional wisdom of using the proportional replication strategy is “suboptimal,” and expand the design space to both “passive replacement policy” and “active push policy” to achieve the optimal replication ratios. We consider practical implementation issues, evaluate the performance of P2P-VoD systems and show how to greatly reduce server's workload and improve streaming quality via our distributed algorithms."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.295"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095536"",""Distributed applications";protocols;modeling;"performance."",""Motion pictures";Bandwidth;Servers;Peer to peer computing;Software;Computer architecture;"Streaming media"","""",""34"",""1"",""22"",""IEEE"",""6 Dec 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Massively multithreaded architectures with large processor counts, like the Cray MTA-1, MTA-2, and XMT, appear to address irregular application requirements better than commodity clusters. However, the research on massively multithreaded systems is currently limited by the lack of adequate architectural simulation infrastructures due to issues such as size of the machines, memory footprint, simulation speed, accuracy, and customization. At the same time, Shared Memory MultiProcessors (SMPs) with multicore processors have become an attractive platform to simulate large-scale systems. This paper introduces a cycle-level simulator of the massively multithreaded Cray XMT supercomputer. The simulator runs unmodified XMT applications. We discuss how we tackled the challenges posed by its development, detailing the techniques implemented to obtain high-simulation speed while maintaining a high accuracy. By mapping XMT processors (ThreadStorm with 128 hardware threads) to host computing cores, the simulation speed remains constant as the number of simulated processors increases, up to the number of available host cores. The simulator supports zero-overhead switching among different accuracy levels at runtime and includes a parametric network and memory model that takes into account contention and hot spotting. On a modern 48-core SMP host, the proposed infrastructure simulates a large set of irregular applications 500 to 2,000 times slower than real time when compared to a 128-processor XMT, with an accuracy error under 10 percent. Emulation is only from 25 to 200 times slower than real time. The paper also presents a case study, where the simulation infrastructure is used to identify bottlenecks in the current XMT architecture and to estimate the performance scaling of a possible multicore design with next generation memory and network interconnect."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.70"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152097"",""Modeling of computer architecture";multithreaded processors;system architectures;integration and modeling;measurement;evaluation;modeling;"simulation of multiple-processor systems"",""Instruction sets";Multiprocessing systems;Multithreading;Synchronization;Multicore processing;"Computational modeling"","""",""5"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""14 Feb 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose a holistic approach called Fidelity-Aware Utilization Controller (FAUC) for Wireless Cyber-physical Surveillance (WCS) systems that combine low-end sensors with cameras for large-scale ad hoc surveillance in unplanned environments. By integrating data fusion with feedback control, FAUC can enforce a CPU utilization upper bound to ensure the system's real-time schedulability although CPU workloads vary significantly at runtime because of stochastic detection results. At the same time, FAUC optimizes system fidelity and adjusts the control objective of CPU utilization adaptively in the presence of variations of target/noise characteristics. We have implemented FAUC on a small-scale WCS testbed consisting of TelosB/Iris motes and cameras. Moreover, we conduct extensive simulations based on real acoustic data traces collected in a vehicle surveillance experiment.

Consequently, an attacker who succeeds in forging multiple hostile identifies can easily launch a Sybil attack, gaining a disproportionately large influence. In this paper, we propose a novel Sybil attack detection mechanism, Footprint, using the trajectories of vehicles for identification while still preserving their location privacy. More specifically, when a vehicle approaches a road-side unit (RSU), it actively demands an authorized message from the RSU as the proof of the appearance time at this RSU. We design a location-hidden authorized message generation scheme for two objectives: first, RSU signatures on messages are signer ambiguous so that the RSU location information is concealed from the resulted authorized message";" second, two authorized messages signed by the same RSU within the same given period of time (temporarily linkable) are recognizable so that they can be used for identification. With the temporal limitation on the linkability of two authorized messages, authorized messages used for long-term identification are prohibited. With this scheme, vehicles can generate a location-hidden trajectory for location-privacy-preserved identification by collecting a consecutive series of authorized messages. Utilizing social relationship among trajectories according to the similarity definition of two trajectories, Footprint can recognize and therefore dismiss “communities” of Sybil trajectories. Rigorous security analysis and extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of Footprint."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.263"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060810"",""Sybil attack";location privacy;signer-ambiguous signature;urban vehicular networks;"location-hidden trajectory."",""Vehicles";Trajectory;Privacy;Wireless communication;Global Positioning System;Communities;"Testing"","""",""92"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""25 Oct 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Implementations of such objects, in modern distributed systems, have to take into account the fact that almost all services, implemented on top of distributed infrastructures, are no longer fully managed due to either their size or their maintenance cost. Therefore, these infrastructures exhibit several autonomic behaviors in order to, for example, tolerate failures and continuous arrival and departure of nodes (churn phenomenon). Among all the shared objects, the register object is a fundamental one. Several protocols have been proposed to build fault resilient registers on top of message-passing system, but, unfortunately, failures are not the only challenge in modern distributed systems and new issues arise in the presence of churn. This paper addresses the construction of a multiwriter/multireader regular register in an eventually synchronous distributed system affected by the continuous arrival/departure of participants.

It is ideal to realize point-to-point routing in wireless sensor networks because packets can be delivered by only maintaining a small set of neighbors' information regardless of network size. It has been successfully employed by geographic routing, which assumes that a packet can be moved closer to the destination in the network topology if it is forwarded geographically closer to the destination in the physical space. This assumption, however, may lead packets to the local minimum where no neighbors of the sender are closer to the destination or low-quality routes that comprise long distance hops of low packet reception ratio. To address the local minimum problem, we propose a topology aware routing (TAR) protocol that efficiently encodes a network topology into a low-dimensional virtual coordinate space where hop distances between pairwise nodes are preserved. Based on precise hop distance comparison, TAR can assist greedy forwarding to find the right neighbor that is one hop closer to the destination and achieve high success ratio of packet delivery without location information. Further, we improve the routing quality by embedding a network topology based on the metric of expected transmission count (ETX). ETX embedding accurately encodes both a network's topological structure and channel quality to nodes' small size virtual coordinates, which helps greedy forwarding to guide a packet along the optimal path that has the fewest number of transmissions. We evaluate our approaches through both simulations and experiments, showing that routing performance are improved in terms of routing success ratio and routing cost."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.175"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5887319"",""Sensor networks";routing;link quality;"topology embedding."",""Routing";Network topology;Extraterrestrial measurements;Wireless sensor networks;Topology;"Base stations"","""",""30"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""16 Jun 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we intend to answer one key question to the success of cloud computing: in cloud, can small-to-medium scale scientific communities benefit from the economies of scale? Our research contributions are threefold: first, we propose an innovative public cloud usage model for small-to-medium scale scientific communities to utilize elastic resources on a public cloud site while maintaining their flexible system controls, i.e., create, activate, suspend, resume, deactivate, and destroy their high-level management entities-service management layers without knowing the details of management. Second, we design and implement an innovative system-DawningCloud, at the core of which are lightweight service management layers running on top of a common management service framework. The common management service framework of DawningCloud not only facilitates building lightweight service management layers for heterogeneous workloads, but also makes their management tasks simple. Third, we evaluate the systems comprehensively using both emulation and real experiments. We found that for four traces of two typical scientific workloads: High-Throughput Computing (HTC) and Many-Task Computing (MTC), DawningCloud saves the resource consumption maximally by 59.5 and 72.6 percent for HTC and MTC service providers, respectively, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 54 percent for the resource provider with respect to the previous two public cloud solutions.

We adopt the concept of entropy in information theory to evaluate the information uncertainty about the region of interest (RoI).

Existing approaches allow balancing network load by changing the georouting protocol used to forward queries in the geographic hash table. However, this comes at the expense of considerably complicating the routing process, which no longer occurs along (near) straight-line trajectories, but requires computing complex geometric transformations. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to balance network traffic load in a geographic hash table without changing the underlying georouting protocol. Instead of changing the (near) straight-line georouting protocol used to send a query from the node issuing the query (the source) to the node managing the queried key (the destination), we propose to “reverse engineer” the hash function used to store data in the network, implementing a sort of “load-aware” assignment of key ranges to wireless sensor nodes. This innovative methodology is instantiated into two specific approaches: an analytical one, in which the destination density function yielding quasiperfect load balancing is analytically characterized under uniformity assumptions for what concerns location of nodes and query sources";" and an iterative, heuristic approach that can be used whenever these uniformity assumptions are not fulfilled. In order to prove practicality of our load balancing methodology, we have performed extensive simulations resembling realistic wireless sensor network deployments showing the effectiveness of the two proposed approaches in considerably improving load balancing and extending network lifetime.

In this paper, we present a multihop incremental reprogramming system called Hermes that transfers over the network the delta between the old and new software and lets the sensor nodes rebuild the new software using the received delta and the old software. It reduces the delta by using techniques to mitigate the effects of function and global variable shifts caused by the software modifications.

We have confirmed that mobility has largely negative impacts on the performance of HSPA networks, as fast-changing wireless environment causes serious service deterioration or even interruption. Meanwhile, our field experiment results have shown unexpected new findings and thereby exposed new features of the mobile HSPA networks, which contradict commonly held views. We surprisingly find out that mobility can improve fairness of bandwidth sharing among users and traffic flows.

Recent measurement studies have shown that the traffic generated by real-world applications reveals the bursty nature in both the spatial domain (i.e., nonuniform distribution of message destinations) and temporal domain (i.e., bursty message arrival process). In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the system performance, a novel analytical model is developed for communication networks in multicluster systems in the presence of the spatio-temporal bursty traffic. The spatial traffic burstiness is captured by the communication locality and the temporal traffic burstiness is modeled by the Markov-modulated Poisson process. After validating its accuracy through extensive simulation experiments, the model is used to investigate the impact of bursty message arrivals and communication locality on network performance.

Therefore, how to propagate information efficiently when message sources vary from time to time is a challenging issue.

Each receiver has a valuation for receiving the multicast service, but such valuation is private information known to itself. A multicast scheme asks each potential receiver to report her valuation, then decides which subset of potential receivers to serve, how to route the multicast flow to them, and how much to charge each of them.

Toward this end, we study the coverage problem of wireless sensor networks for the rolling terrains, and derive the expected coverage ratios under the stochastic sensors deployment. According to the different terrain features, we investigate two kinds of terrain coverage problems: the regular terrain coverage problem and the irregular terrain coverage problem. Specifically, we derive the general expression of the expected coverage ratio for an arbitrary surface z=f(x, y) and build two models, cone model and Cos-revolution model, to estimate the expected coverage ratios for regular terrains.

In these applications, sensor nodes use batteries as the sole energy source. Therefore, energy efficiency becomes critical. We observe that many WSN applications require redundant sensor nodes to achieve fault tolerance and Quality of Service (QoS) of the sensing. However, the same redundancy may not be necessary for multihop communication because of the light traffic load and the stable wireless links. In this paper, we present a novel sleep-scheduling technique called Virtual Backbone Scheduling (VBS). VBS is designed for WSNs has redundant sensor nodes. VBS forms multiple overlapped backbones which work alternatively to prolong the network lifetime. In VBS, traffic is only forwarded by backbone sensor nodes, and the rest of the sensor nodes turn off their radios to save energy. The rotation of multiple backbones makes sure that the energy consumption of all sensor nodes is balanced, which fully utilizes the energy and achieves a longer network lifetime compared to the existing techniques. The scheduling problem of VBS is formulated as the Maximum Lifetime Backbone Scheduling (MLBS) problem. Since the MLBS problem is NP-hard, we propose approximation algorithms based on the Schedule Transition Graph (STG) and Virtual Scheduling Graph (VSG).

Message routing in DTNs usually employs a multicopy forwarding scheme. To avoid the cost associated with flooding, much effort has been focused on opportunistic forwarding, which aims to reduce the cost of forwarding while retaining high routing performance by forwarding messages only to nodes that have high delivery probabilities. This paper presents two multicopy forwarding protocols, called optimal opportunistic forwarding (OOF) and OOF-, which maximize the expected delivery rate and minimize the expected delay, respectively, while requiring that the number of forwardings per message does not exceed a certain threshold. Our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows: We apply the optimal stopping rule in the multicopy opportunistic forwarding protocol. Specifically, we propose two optimal opportunistic forwarding metrics to maximize delivery probability and minimize delay, respectively, with a fixed number of copies and within a given time-to-live. We implement and evaluate OOF and OOF- as well as several other representative forwarding protocols, i.e., Epidemic, Spray-and-wait, MaxProp* and Delegation. We perform trace-driven simulations using both real and synthetic traces.

As the peers participating in unstructured networks interconnect randomly, they rely on flooding query messages to discover objects of interest and thus introduce remarkable network traffic. Empirical measurement studies indicate that the peers in P2P networks have similar preferences, and have recently proposed unstructured P2P networks that organize participating peers by exploiting their similarity. The resultant networks may not perform searches efficiently and effectively because existing overlay topology construction algorithms often create unstructured P2P networks without performance guarantees. Thus, we propose a novel overlay formation algorithm for unstructured P2P networks. Based on the file sharing pattern exhibiting the power-law property, our proposal is unique in that it poses rigorous performance guarantees. Theoretical performance results conclude that in a constant probability, 1) searching an object in our proposed network efficiently takes O(\ln^{c} {\cal N}) hops (where c is a small constant), and 2) the search progressively and effectively exploits the similarity of peers. In addition, the success ratio of discovering an object approximates 100 percent. We validate our theoretical analysis and compare our proposal to competing algorithms in simulations. Based on the simulation results, our proposal clearly outperforms the competing algorithms in terms of 1) the hop count of routing a query message, 2) the successful ratio of resolving a query, 3) the number of messages required for resolving a query, and 4) the message overhead for maintaining and formatting the overlay."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.241"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035690"",""Peer-to-peer systems";unstructured overlay networks;"search."",""Peer to peer computing";Proposals;Semantics;Protocols;Network topology;Search problems;"Topology"","""",""22"","""",""54"",""IEEE"",""6 Oct 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We argue that a network of mobile sensor nodes which can perform self-adjustment is the best candidate to maintain the coverage of the surface area. In our application, we face a unique double mobility coverage problem. That is, there is an uncontrollable mobility, U-Mobility, by the flows which breaks the coverage of the sensor network. Moreover, there is also a controllable mobility, C-Mobility, by the mobile nodes which we can utilize to reinstall the coverage. Our objective is to build an energy efficient scheme for the sensor network coverage issue with this double mobility behavior. A key observation of our scheme is that the motion of the flow is not only a curse but should also be considered as a fortune. The sensor nodes can be pushed to some locations by the U-Mobility that potentially help to improve the overall coverage. With that taken into consideration, more efficient movement decision can be made. To this end, we present a dominating set maintenance scheme to maximally exploit the U-Mobility and balance the energy consumption among all the sensor nodes. We prove that the coverage is guaranteed in our scheme. We further propose a fully distributed protocol that addresses a set of practical issues.

Discrete event simulation is a central tool in this effort. As proscribed by Moore's law, the number of transistors which can be placed on an IC doubles every 18 months. As a result, simulation has become the major bottleneck in the circuit design process. To alleviate this difficulty, it is possible to make use of parallel (or distributed) circuit simulation. In this paper, we make use of a parallel gate-level simulator which we developed and which is based upon Time Warp. Gate-level simulations exhibit two characteristics which can easily result in either instability or severely degraded simulation performance. Because of the low computational granularity of a gate-level simulation and because the computational load varies throughout the course of the simulation, the performance of Time Warp can be either severely degraded or be unstable. Restraining the optimism of Time Warp via a bounded window and utilizing dynamic load balancing are approaches to deal with these difficulties. In this paper, we make use of learning techniques from artificial intelligence (multiagent Q-learning, simulated annealing) to develop a combined bounded window and dynamic load balancing algorithm for parallel digital logic simulation.

Numerical examples offered by the model shed light on the operational and system settings for which the Markovian setting, resulting from employing an exponential-distribution assumption on the event times, yields inaccurate predictions.

This need is further exacerbated by IT system “agility,” which mandates the tracing tool to provide online performance data since offline approaches cannot reflect system changes in real time. Moreover, considering the large scale of deployed services, a pragmatic tracing approach should be scalable in terms of the cost in collecting and analyzing logs. In this paper, we introduce a precise, scalable, and online request tracing tool for multitier services of black boxes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a precise request tracing algorithm for multitier services of black boxes, which only uses application-independent knowledge. Second, we present a microlevel abstraction, component activity graph, to represent causal paths of each request. On the basis of this abstraction, we use dominated causal path patterns to represent repeatedly executed causal paths that account for significant fractions, and we further present a derived performance metric of causal path patterns, latency percentages of components, to enable debugging performance-in-the-large. Third, we develop two mechanisms, tracing on demand and sampling, to significantly increase the system scalability. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, called PreciseTracer, and release it as open source code. In comparison with WAP5-a black-box tracing approach, PreciseTracer achieves higher tracing accuracy and faster response time.

This is in contrast to the previous constructions, where multiple authorities must be online and setup the system interactively, which is impractical. Hence, it is clear that a decentralized ABE scheme eliminates the heavy communication cost and the need for collaborative computation in the setup stage. Furthermore, every authority can join or leave the system freely without the necessity of reinitializing the system. In contemporary multiauthority ABE schemes, a user's secret keys from different authorities must be tied to his global identifier (GID) to resist the collusion attack. However, this will compromise the user's privacy. Multiple authorities can collaborate to trace the user by his GID, collect his attributes, then impersonate him. Therefore, constructing a decentralized ABE scheme with privacy-preserving remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized key-policy ABE scheme where each authority can issue secret keys to a user independently without knowing anything about his GID. Therefore, even if multiple authorities are corrupted, they cannot collect the user's attributes by tracing his GID. Notably, our scheme only requires standard complexity assumptions (e.g., decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman) and does not require any cooperation between the multiple authorities, in contrast to the previous comparable scheme that requires nonstandard complexity assumptions (e.g., q-decisional Diffie-Hellman inversion) and interactions among multiple authorities.

To accelerate memory consistency verification, previous approaches have to bear the cost of availability (e.g., relying on dedicated hardware supports that have not been offered by many commodity CMPs) or completeness (e.g., missing some bugs). In the meantime, the impact of parallel programs on memory consistency verification has more or less been overlooked. One piece of evidence is that few investigations have been dedicated to finding appropriate test programs enabling more efficient verification From a novel perspective of test program, we devise a practical technique called “program regularization,” which can effectively reduce the computation time of memory consistency verification. The key intuition behind program regularization is that any parallel program, if being reformed appropriately, can enable efficient memory consistency verification. More specifically, for an original program, program regularization introduces some auxiliary memory addresses, and periodically inserts load/store operations accessing these addresses to the original program. With the regularized program, memory consistency verification can be accomplished in linear time (with respect to the number of memory operations) when the number of processors is fixed. Experimental results show that program regularization can significantly accelerate memory consistency verification.

This framework is applied to extract algorithmic parallelisms at various granularities, namely, multigrain parallelism. Our parallelism is intrinsic and platform independent and can provide insights into architectural information, thus facilitating mapping onto generic platforms and early back annotation for modifying algorithms. It plays a significant role in the concurrent optimization of both algorithms and architectures, referred to as Algorithm/Architecture Coexploration (AAC), by trading off between the DoP and the number of operations (NoO). This paper reports three case studies for AAC. The case study on an IDCT reveals that our framework accurately quantifies the parallelism for mapping the algorithm onto generic platforms, including FPGA and multicore systems. The IDCT parallelized by our technique surpasses a conventional spectral parallelization. By exploiting fine-grain parallelism, this paper presents a better porting of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) onto single instruction multiple data (SIMD) machines compared with a commercial compiler.

This paper further develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attack, a special type of false data injection attack. The damage of LR attacks to power system operations can manifest in an immediate or a delayed fashion. For the immediate attacking goal, we show in this paper that the most damaging attack can be identified through a max-min attacker-defender model. Benders decomposition within a restart framework is used to solve the bilevel immediate LR attack problem with a moderate computational effort. Its effectiveness has been validated by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method solution in our previous work. For the delayed attacking goal, we propose a trilevel model to identify the most damaging attack and transform the model into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer problem for final solution.

For a large-scale distributed CPS comprising of numerous machines, sharing radio resource efficiently with the existing wireless networks while maintaining sufficient quality of service (QoS) for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications becomes an essential and challenging requirement. By clustering CPS machines as a swarm with the cluster head managing radio resources inside the swarm, spectrum sharing among numerous machines can be achieved in a distributed and scalable fashion. Specifically, we apply the recent innovation, cognitive radio, and a special mode in cognitive radio, interweave coexistence, to leverage machines to collect radio resource usage information for autonomous and interference-free radio resource management in the CPS. To reduce the communication overheads of channel sensing feed backing from machines, we apply compressive sensing to construct a spectrum map indicating the radio resource availability on any given locations within the CPS coverage. Such spectrum map resource management (SMRM) only utilizes a small portion of machines to perform channel sensing but enables distributed cluster-based spectrum sharing in an efficient way. Through the concept of effective capacity, the SMRM controls available resources to guarantee the QoS for communications of CPS.

For example, the base station cannot retrieve the maximum value of all sensing data if the aggregated result is the summation of sensing data.

We propose the use of a more relaxed concurrency control algorithm to provide better concurrency. This algorithm is based on the conflict-serializability (CS) model. Unlike 2PL, it allows some transactions to commit successfully even when they make conflicting accesses. We implement this algorithm in a STM system and evaluate its performance on 16 cores using standard benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm improves the performance of applications with long transactions and high abort rates. Throughput is improved by up to 2.99 times despite the overheads of testing for CS at runtime.

One challenge in such large-scale application state monitoring is to organize nodes into a monitoring overlay that achieves monitoring scalability and cost effectiveness at the same time. In this paper, we present REMO, a REsource-aware application state MOnitoring system, to address the challenge of monitoring overlay construction. REMO distinguishes itself from existing works in several key aspects. First, it jointly considers intertask cost-sharing opportunities and node-level resource constraints. Furthermore, it explicitly models the per-message processing overhead which can be substantial but is often ignored by previous works. Second, REMO produces a forest of optimized monitoring trees through iterations of two phases. One phase explores cost-sharing opportunities between tasks, and the other refines the tree with resource-sensitive construction schemes. Finally, REMO also employs an adaptive algorithm that balances the benefits and costs of overlay adaptation. This is particularly useful for large systems with constantly changing monitoring tasks. Moreover, we enhance REMO in terms of both performance and applicability with a series of optimization and extension techniques. We perform extensive experiments including deploying REMO on a BlueGene/P rack running IBM's large-scale distributed streaming system - System S.

Among various properties the applications may specify, the concurrency property, i.e., property delineating concurrency among contextual activities, is of great importance. It is because the concurrency property is one of the most frequently specified properties by context-aware applications. Moreover, the concurrency property serves as the basis for specification of many other properties. Existing schemes implicitly assume that context collecting devices share the same notion of time. Thus, the concurrency property can be easily detected. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in pervasive computing environments, which are characterized by the asynchronous coordination among heterogeneous computing entities. To cope with this challenge, we identify and address three essential issues. First, we introduce logical time to model behavior of the asynchronous pervasive computing environment. Second, we propose the logic for specification of the concurrency property. Third, we propose the Concurrent contextual Activity Detection in Asynchronous environments (CADA) algorithm, which achieves runtime detection of the concurrency property. Performance analysis and experimental evaluation show that CADA effectively detects the concurrency property in asynchronous pervasive computing scenarios."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.176"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5887320"",""Concurrency property";context-awareness;"asynchronous environment."",""Concurrent computing";Context;Pervasive computing;Lattices;Runtime;Semantics;"Algorithm design and analysis"","""",""13"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""16 Jun 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

To meet performance demands, packet processing systems on routers employ multiple processor cores. To efficiently utilize processing resources in such systems, we propose a novel methodology for allocating tasks to processors. The main idea is to obtain runtime profiling information and to duplicate tasks with heavy processing requirements. Using our duplication algorithm, a balanced workload can be obtained and the complexity of packing tasks with different processing requirements can be reduced. By translating traffic characteristics into processing requirements, the system is able to adapt to dynamic changes in the workload and balance the utilization of all processing resources to maximize system throughput. Our approach can adapt to any traffic change in a single iteration, whereas existing adaptive approaches may require multiple steps. Results from our prototype implementation based on the Click modular router show that our system only requires on average 5.3-31.5 percent of the adaptation steps that are necessary in iterative systems.

AMI in smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system (CPS) example, in which large amount of data from hundreds of thousands of smart meters are collected and processed through an AMI communication infrastructure. Scalability is one of the most important issues for the AMI deployment in smart grid. In this study, we introduce a new performance metric, accumulated bandwidth-distance product (ABDP), to represent the total communication resource usages. For each distributed communication architecture, we formulate an optimization problem and obtain the solutions for minimizing the total cost of the system that considers both the ABDP and the deployment cost of the meter data management system (MDMS). The simulation results indicate the significant benefits of the distributed communication architectures over the traditional centralized one. More importantly, we analyze the scalability of the total cost of the communication system (including MDMS) with regard to the traffic load on the smart meters for both the centralized and the distributed communication architectures. Through the closed form expressions obtained in our analysis, we demonstrate that the total cost for the centralized architecture scales linearly as O(\lambda N), with N being the number of smart meters, and \lambda being the average traffic rate on a smart meter.

There is no doubt that the scalability of a feedback aggregating overlay is the most fundamental requirement for large-scale P2P computing. However, most previous works either paid little attention to the scalability of feedback aggregating overlay or relied on the flooding-based strategy to collect feedback, which greatly affects the system scalability. In this paper, we proposed a scalable feedback aggregating (SFA) overlay for large-scale P2P trust evaluation. First, the local trust rating method is defined based on the time attenuation function, which can satisfy the two dynamic properties of trust. The SFA overlay is then proposed from a scalable perspective. Not only can the SFA overlay strengthen the scalability of the feedback aggregation mechanism for large-scale P2P applications, but it can also reduce networking risk and improve system efficiency. More importantly, based on the SFA overlay, an adaptive trustworthiness computing method can be defined. This method surpasses the limitations of traditional weighting methods for trust factors, in which weights are assigned subjectively. Finally, the authors design the key techniques and security mechanism to be simple in implementation for the easy incorporation of the mechanism into the existing P2P overlay network. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, the SFA-based trust model shows remarkable enhancement in scalability for large-scale P2P computing, as well as has greater adaptability and accuracy in handling various dynamic behaviors of peers."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.26"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133278"",""Large-scale P2P computing";trust management;feedback aggregating overlay;scalability;"adaptability"",""Peer to peer computing";Nickel;Scalability;Attenuation;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;"Probabilistic logic"","""",""50"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""17 Jan 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we study a highly scalable monitoring network for distributed applications. In the network, there are distributed monitors collecting application performance in two steps: first, client applications report their performance to some proxies by means of a client overlay, and then the proxies report the performance to the distributed monitors using another proxy overlay.

This is especially challenging because of the relatively low bandwidth of the on-board network, and the emerging needs of heterogeneous flows due to the proliferation of avionics applications. Redundant transmission and hard real-time scheduling potentially generate many duplicate data, which makes deduplication become more difficult. Many avionic flows further exhibit dynamic workloads which may change abruptly online. Hence, besides the guarantee of transmission delay, modern avionic network design needs to flexibly handle burst flows and efficiently implement data deduplication for bandwidth saving. In order to address these challenges, we propose a DeDuplication-aware Deficit Round Robin (D2DRR)-based scheduling scheme for Avionics Full DupleX (AFDX) networks with the benefits of low complexity and easy implementation. The core idea is to judiciously offer proper “division of labor” between switches and end systems and transform the services for heterogeneous flows to a single representation of utilization, i.e., DRR quantum, which can be flexibly reconfigured. We further leverage Bloom filters to support fast deduplication in order to reduce the load on the AFDX network. D2DRR, hence, offers salient features, elastic scheduling and adept deduplication, to deliver substantial performance improvements.

In a modern data center, however, power control needs to be enforced at three levels: rack enclosure, power distribution unit, and the entire data center, due to the physical and contractual power limits at each level. This paper presents SHIP, a highly scalable hierarchical power control architecture for large-scale data centers.

When a critical event occurs, an alarm message should be broadcast to the entire network as soon as possible. To prolong the network lifetime, some sleep scheduling methods are always employed in WSNs, resulting in significant broadcasting delay, especially in large scale WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel sleep scheduling method to reduce the delay of alarm broadcasting from any sensor node in WSNs. Specifically, we design two determined traffic paths for the transmission of alarm message, and level-by-level offset based wake-up pattern according to the paths, respectively. When a critical event occurs, an alarm is quickly transmitted along one of the traffic paths to a center node, and then it is immediately broadcast by the center node along another path without collision. Therefore, two of the big contributions are that the broadcasting delay is independent of the density of nodes and its energy consumption is ultra low. Exactly, the upper bound of the broadcasting delay is only 3D+2L, where D is the maximum hop of nodes to the center node, L is the length of sleeping duty cycle, and the unit is the size of time slot.

High throughput in a wireless network requires a relatively low complex scheduling policy with a provable efficiency ratio, which is a measure of the performance of the policy in terms of throughput and stability. For most scheduling policies that achieve provable ratios, at the onset of every frame, a selection is made of a subset of links to transmit data in the immediately following frame. In this paper, we propose a policy that allows links to transmit data in any future frame by means of frame reservations. The new, reservation-based distributed scheduling approach will improve the capacity of the system and provide greater throughput. First, we create a framework to analyze the stability of reservation-based scheduling systems. Then, to demonstrate its efficacy, we propose a reservation-based distributed scheduling policy for IEEE 802.16 mesh networks and use the new framework to find sufficient conditions for the stability of the network under this policy, i.e., we find a lower bound for its efficiency ratio.

The results are useful for optimizing and parallelizing compilers, which need to quantitatively assess the profitability of transformations when performing aggressive optimizations and parallelization. This paper presents a PPA technique using the static single assignment (SSA) form. When computing the probabilistic points-to relationships of a specific pointer, a pointer relation graph (PRG) is first built to represent all of the possible points-to relationships of the pointer. The PRG is transformed by a sequence of reduction operations into a compact graph, from which the probabilistic points-to relationships of the pointer can be determined. In addition, PPA is further extended to interprocedural cases by considering function related statements. We have implemented our proposed scheme including static and profiling versions in the Open64 compiler, and performed experiments to obtain the accuracy and scalability. The static version estimates branch probabilities by assuming that every conditional is equally likely to be true or false, and that every loop executes 10 times before terminating. The profiling version measures branch probabilities dynamically from past program executions using a default workload provided with the benchmark. The average errors for selected benchmarks were 3.80 percent in the profiling version and 9.13 percent in the static version. Finally, SPEC CPU2006 is used to evaluate the scalability, and the result indicates that our scheme is sufficiently efficient in practical use.

For example, most existing system VMs resort to gang scheduling a guest OS's virtual processors (VCPUs) to avoid OS synchronization overhead. However, gang scheduling is infeasible for some application domains, and is inflexible in other domains. In an overcommitted environment, an individual guest OS has more VCPUs than available physical processors (PCPUs), precluding the use of gang scheduling. In such an environment, we demonstrate a more than two-fold increase in application runtime when transparently virtualizing a chip-multiprocessor's cores. To combat this problem, we propose a hardware technique to detect when a VCPU is wasting CPU cycles, and preempt that VCPU to run a different, more productive VCPU. Our technique can dramatically reduce cycles wasted on OS synchronization, without requiring any semantic information from the software. We then present a server consolidation case study to demonstrate the potential of more flexible scheduling policies enabled by our technique. We propose one such policy that logically partitions the CMP cores between guest VMs. This policy increases throughput by 10-25 percent for consolidated server workloads due to improved cache locality and core utilization."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.143"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765949"",""Multicore";virtualization;synchronization;"operating systems."",""Hardware";Synchronization;Kernel;Arrays;Virtual machining;"Servers"","""",""9"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""12 May 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The observed influence is often constrained by the reliance on simulators, the use of out-of-date benchmarks, or the limited coverage of deciding factors. This paper describes a systematic measurement of the influence with most of the potentially important factors covered. The measurement shows some surprising results. Contrary to commonly perceived importance of cache sharing, neither positive nor negative effects from the cache sharing are significant for most of the program executions in the PARSEC benchmark suite, regardless of the types of parallelism, input data sets, architectures, numbers of threads, and assignments of threads to cores. After a detailed analysis, we find that the main reason is the mismatch between the software design (and compilation) of multithreaded applications and CMP architectures. By performing source code transformations on the programs in a cache-sharing-aware manner, we observe up to 53 percent performance increase when the threads are placed on cores appropriately, confirming the software-hardware mismatch as a main reason for the observed insignificance of the influence from cache sharing, and indicating the important role of cache-sharing-aware transformations-a topic only sporadically studied so far-for exerting the power of shared cache."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.130"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095485"",""Shared cache";thread scheduling;parallel program optimizations;"chip multiprocessors."",""Instruction sets";Message systems;Benchmark testing;Libraries;Arrays;"Systematics"","""",""9"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""6 Dec 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in sensor networks that make use of the existing key predistribution schemes for pairwise key establishment and authentication between sensor nodes and mobile sinks, the employment of mobile sinks for data collection elevates a new security challenge: in the basic probabilistic and q-composite key predistribution schemes, an attacker can easily obtain a large number of keys by capturing a small fraction of nodes, and hence, can gain control of the network by deploying a replicated mobile sink preloaded with some compromised keys. This article describes a three-tier general framework that permits the use of any pairwise key predistribution scheme as its basic component. The new framework requires two separate key pools, one for the mobile sink to access the network, and one for pairwise key establishment between the sensors. To further reduce the damages caused by stationary access node replication attacks, we have strengthened the authentication mechanism between the sensor and the stationary access node in the proposed framework.

Adopting Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, we devise two many-to-one cooperative schemes under convergecast for both static and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), respectively. We call them Convergimo Schemes. In static networks, our Convergimo scheme highly utilizes hierarchical cooperation MIMO transmission. This feature overcomes the bottleneck which hinders convergecast traffic from yielding ideal performance in traditional ad hoc network, by turning the originally interfering signals into interference-resistant ones. It helps to achieve an aggregate throughput up to Ω(n1-ϵ) for any ϵ >";"0. In the mobile ad hoc case, our Convergimo scheme characterizes on joint transmission from multiple nodes to multiple receivers. With optimal network division where the number of nodes per cell is constantly bounded, the achievable per-node throughput can reach Θ(1) with the corresponding delay reduced to Θ(k). The gain comes from the strong and intelligent cooperation between nodes in our scheme, along with the maximum number of concurrent active cells and the shortest waiting time before transmission for each node within a cell. This increases the chances for each destination to receive the data it needs with minimum overhead on extra transmission. Moreover, our converge-based analysis well unifies and generalizes previous work since the results derived from convergecast in our schemes can also cover other traffic patterns. Last but not the least, our schemes are of interest not only from a theoretical perspective but also provide useful theoretical guidelines to future design of MIMO schemes in wireless networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.194"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953594"",""Convergecast";throughput;delay;"MIMO."",""Throughput";MIMO;Delay;Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Joints;"Antennas"","""",""9"","""",""21"",""IEEE"",""14 Jul 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

The resulting BFT framework for WS-AT is useful for business applications that are based on WS-AT and that require a high degree of dependability, security, and trust."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.292"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095533"",""Atomic transactions";distributed transactions;service-oriented computing;Web Services;dependability;security;trust;encryption;authentication;"Byzantine fault tolerance."",""Protocols";Security;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;"Simple object access protocol"","""",""37"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""6 Dec 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Although RCU updates are relatively heavy weight, the importance of read-side performance is increasing as computing systems become more responsive to changes in their environments. RCU is heavily used in several kernel-level environments. Unfortunately, kernel-level implementations use facilities that are often unavailable to user applications. The few prior user-level RCU implementations either provided inefficient read-side primitives or restricted the application architecture. This paper fills this gap by describing efficient and flexible RCU implementations based on primitives commonly available to user-level applications. Finally, this paper compares these RCU implementations with each other and with standard locking, which enables choosing the best mechanism for a given workload. This work opens the door to widespread user-application use of RCU."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.159"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871597"",""Synchronization";process management;operating systems;software/software engineering;threads;"concurrency."",""Scalability";Data structures;Materials;Synchronization;Instruction sets;Kernel;"Linux"","""",""101"",""41"",""29"",""IEEE"",""9 Jun 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

The ESC capture the frequency of accesses to the elements of a data collection, and the evolution of the access patterns for each node in a network of computers. The ESC can be efficiently summarized into what we call ESC-summaries to obtain approximate statistics of the document entries accessed by each computing node. We use the ESC-summaries to introduce two algorithms that manage our distributed caching strategy, one for the distribution of the cache contents, ESC-placement, and another one for the search of documents in the distributed cache, ESC-search. While the former improves the hit rate of the system and keeps a large ratio of data accesses local, the latter reduces the network traffic by restricting the number of nodes queried to find a document. We show that our cooperative caching approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both hit rate, throughput, and location recall for multiple scenarios, i.e., different query distributions and systems with varying degrees of complexity."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.162"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871600"",""Distributed systems";distributed caching;resource intensive applications;"count filter."",""Search engines";Radiation detectors;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Cooperative caching;"Data structures"","""",""2"","""",""35"",""IEEE"",""9 Jun 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Large appliance size obstructs IaaS systems to deliver dynamic and scalable infrastructures according to their promise. To overcome this issue, this paper offers a novel technique for virtual appliance developers to publish appliances for the dynamic environments of IaaS systems. Our solution achieves faster virtual machine instantiation by reducing the appliance size while maintaining its key functionality. The new virtual appliance optimization algorithm identifies the removable parts of the appliance. Then, it applies active fault injection to remove the identified parts. Afterward, our solution assesses the functionality of the reduced virtual appliance by applying the-appliance developer provided-validation algorithms. We also introduce a technique to parallelize the fault injection and validation phases of the algorithm. Finally, the prototype implementation of the algorithm is discussed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm through the optimization of two well-known virtual appliances. Results show that the algorithm significantly decreased virtual machine instantiation time and increased dynamism in IaaS systems."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.309"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122019"",""Virtual appliance";optimization;cloud computing;"IaaS"",""Home appliances";Optimization;Virtual machining;Software algorithms;Software packages;"Heuristic algorithms"","""",""3"","""",""40"",""IEEE"",""3 Jan 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All these protocols organize nodes in an unstructured random overlay network. In many cases, it is interesting to bias the random overlay in order to optimize some efficiency criteria, for instance, to reduce the stretch of the overlay routing. In this paper, we propose X-BOT, a new protocol that allows to bias the topology of an unstructured gossip overlay network. X-BOT is completely decentralized and, unlike previous approaches, preserves several key properties of the original (nonbiased) overlay (most notably, the node degree and consequently, the overlay connectivity). Experimental results show that X-BOT can generate more efficient overlays than previous approaches independently of the underlying physical network topology."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2012.29"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133281"",""Peer-to-peer systems";unstructured overlay networks;topology adaptation;"network protocols"",""Peer to peer computing";Protocols;Topology;Network topology;Optimization;Measurement;"Reliability"","""",""10"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""17 Jan 2012"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;
