However, setting up a centralized firewall for a whole cloud data center is infeasible from both performance and financial aspects. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cloud firewall framework for individual cloud customers. We investigate how to dynamically allocate resources to optimize resources provisioning cost, while satisfying QoS requirement specified by individual customers simultaneously. Moreover, we establish novel queuing theory based model M/Geo/1 and M/Geo/m for quantitative system analysis, where the service times follow a geometric distribution. By employing Z-transform and embedded Markov chain techniques, we obtain a closed-form expression of mean packet response time. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we conclude that an M/Geo/1 model reflects the cloud firewall real system much better than a traditional M/M/1 model.

We propose a differentiated adaptive quality optimization algorithm, called Scalable Video Coding Quality Adaptation algorithm (SVC-QA), which adapts streaming quality based on both system-level and client-level optimization to optimize streaming quality according to network bandwidth conditions, content characteristics, a user's quality preferences, and buffering capacities of different client devices (e.g., mobile phones, PCs, HDTVs, etc.).

In this paper, we introduce a family of bit-representation-optimized (BRO) compression formats for representing sparse matrices on GPUs. The proposed formats - BRO-CSR, BRO-ELL and BRO-HYB, perform compression on index data and help to speed up SpMV on GPUs through the reduction of memory traffic. We also propose two other hybrid BRO formats which can potentially perform better than both HYB and BRO-HYB formats. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to uncompressed CSR and ELLPACK formats, our proposed compressed BRO-CSR and BRO-ELL formats are able to achieve average speedups of 2× and 1.4× respectively.

The publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model is widely used to disseminate data because of its possibility of expanding the system to Internet-scale size. However, existing pub/sub systems are inadequate to meet the requirement of disseminating live content in the big data era, since their multi-hop routing techniques and coarse-grained partitioning techniques lead to a low matching throughput, and their upload capacities do not scale well. In this paper, we propose a general scalable and elastic pub/sub service based on the cloud computing environment, called GSEC. For generality, we propose a two-layer pub/sub framework to support the dissemination with diverse data sizes and data dimensionality. For scalability, a hybrid space partitioningtechnique is proposed to achieve high matching throughput, which divides subscriptions into multiple clusters in a hierarchical manner. Moreover, a helper-based content distribution technique is proposed to achieve high upload bandwidth, where servers act as both providers and coordinators to fully explore the upload capacity of the system. For elasticity, we propose a performance-aware provisioningtechnique to adjust the scale of servers to adapt to the churn workloads. To evaluate the performance of GSEC, about 1,000 servers are deployed and hundreds of thousands of live content items are tested in our CloudStack-based testbed. Extensive experiments confirm that GSEC can linearly increase the capacities of event matching and content distribution with the growth of servers, adaptively adjust these capacities in tens of seconds according to the churn workloads, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under various parameter settings."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2346759"",""National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2011CB302601)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61379052); National High Technology Research and Development 863 Program of China(grant numbers:2013AA01A213); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province(grant numbers:14JJ1026); Doctoral Program of Higher Education(grant numbers:20124307110015);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876150"",""Publish/subscribe";event matching;space partitioning;content distribution;"cloud computing"",""Subscriptions";Servers;Routing;Clustering algorithms;Throughput;Scalability;"Humidity"","""",""41"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""12 Aug 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, an improved hybrid version of the CRO method called HCRO (hybrid CRO) is developed for solving the DAG-based task scheduling problem. In HCRO, the CRO method is integrated with the novel heuristic approaches, and a new selection strategy is proposed. More specifically, the following contributions are made in this paper. (1) A Gaussian random walk approach is proposed to search for optimal local candidate solutions. (2) A left or right rotating shift method based on the theory of maximum Hamming distance is used to guarantee that our HCRO algorithm can escape from local optima.

Our solution introduces hybrid automata to formally describe and analyze CPS design patterns. We propose a novel leasing based design pattern, along with closed-form configuration constraints, to guarantee PTE safety rules under arbitrary wireless communication faults. We propose a formal procedure to transform the design pattern hybrid automata into specific wireless CPS designs. This procedure can effectively isolate physical world parameters from affecting the PTE safety of the resultant specific designs. We conduct two wireless CPS case studies, one on medicine and the other on control, to show that the resulted system is safe against communication failures.

To provide high quality video streaming, Forward Error Correction (FEC) is one of the most popular approaches to ensure the needed quality for video streaming by generating duplicated packets. However, several factors might cause problems to FEC in a VANET, like the limited resources of wireless networks, a highly dynamic topology and the large amount of data in video streaming. The duplicated packets might exceed the network capacity. Therefore, in this work, the retransmission mechanism is used to ensure the transmissions, rather than the FEC. The main problem of the retransmission mechanism is the delay. A multi-path solution based on a disjoint algorithm is proposed to reduce the interference and contention, leading to a higher transmission rate and an acceptable delay. In this solution, only I-frames are transmitted through the TCP protocol, and the inter-frames are transmitted through the UDP protocol.

These P2P communications cause an additional synchronization point with relatively high message latency costs due to small message sizes. In these solvers, each SpMxV is usually followed by an inner product computation that involves the output vector of SpMxV. Here, we exploit this property to propose a novel parallelization method that avoids the latency costs and synchronization overhead of P2P communications. Our method involves a computational and a communication rearrangement scheme. The computational rearrangement provides an alternative method for forming input vector of SpMxV and allows P2P and collective communications to be performed in a single phase. The communication rearrangement realizes this opportunity by embedding P2P communications into global collective communication operations. The proposed method grants a certain value on the maximum number of messages communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern of the matrix. The downside, however, is the increased message volume and the negligible redundant computation. We favor reducing the message latency costs at the expense of increasing message volume. Yet, we propose two iterative-improvementbased heuristics to alleviate the increase in the volume through one-to-one task-to-processor mapping. Our experiments on two supercomputers, Cray XE6 and IBM BlueGene/Q, up to 2,048 processors show that the proposed parallelization method exhibits superior scalable performance compared to the conventional parallelization method."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2311804"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766662"",""Parallel linear iterative solvers";sparse matrix vector multiplication;point-to-point communication;inner product computation;conjugate gradient;collective communication;message latency overhead;avoiding latency;hiding latency;"iterative improvement heuristic"",""Vectors";Program processors;Sparse matrices;Synchronization;Partitioning algorithms;Iterative methods;"Parallel algorithms"","""",""11"","""",""30"",""OAPA"",""13 Mar 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While relatively accurate performance models exist for conventional CPUs, accurate performance estimation models for modern GPUs do not exist. This paper presents two accurate models for modern GPUs: a sampling-based linear model, and a model based on machine-learning (ML) techniques which improves the accuracy of the linear model and is applicable to modern GPUs with and without caches. We first construct the sampling-based linear model to predict the runtime of an arbitrary OpenCL kernel. Based on an analysis of NVIDIA GPUs' scheduling policies we determine the earliest sampling points that allow an accurate estimation. The linear model cannot capture well the significant effects that memory coalescing or caching as implemented in modern GPUs have on performance. We therefore propose a model based on ML techniques that takes several compiler-generated statistics about the kernel as well as the GPU's hardware performance counters as additional inputs to obtain a more accurate runtime performance estimation for modern GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of the model by applying it to three different NVIDIA GPU architectures and one AMD GPU architecture. On an extensive set of OpenCL benchmarks, on average, the proposed model estimates the runtime performance with less than 7 percent error for a second-generation GTX 280 with no on-chip caches and less than 5 percent for the Fermi-based GTX 580 with hardware caches. On the Kepler-based GTX 680, the linear model has an error of less than 10 percent. On an AMD GPU architecture, Radeon HD 6970, the model estimates with 8 percent of error rates. The proposed technique outperforms existing models by a factor of 5 to 6 in terms of accuracy."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2333526"",""National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2013R1A3A2003664)"; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology(grant numbers:2012R1A1A1042938); Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC02-06CH11357); Office of Science(grant numbers:DE-AC02-06CH11357);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844867"",""GPU";performance modeling;caches;scheduling;OpenCL;NVIDIA;"AMD"",""Graphics processing units";Kernel;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Data models;"Estimation"","""",""24"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""26 Jun 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Clustering peers by their common interests can significantly enhance the efficiency of file query. Clustering peers by their physical proximity can also improve file query performance. However, few current works are able to cluster peers based on both peer interest and physical proximity. Although structured P2Ps provide higher file query efficiency than unstructured P2Ps, it is difficult to realize it due to their strictly defined topologies. In this work, we introduce a Proximity-Aware and Interest-clustered P2P file sharing System (PAIS) based on a structured P2P, which forms physically-close nodes into a cluster and further groups physically-close and common-interest nodes into a sub-cluster based on a hierarchical topology. PAIS uses an intelligent file replication algorithm to further enhance file query efficiency. It creates replicas of files that are frequently requested by a group of physically close nodes in their location. Moreover, PAIS enhances the intra-sub-cluster file searching through several approaches. First, it further classifies the interest of a sub-cluster to a number of sub-interests, and clusters common-sub-interest nodes into a group for file sharing. Second, PAIS builds an overlay for each group that connects lower capacity nodes to higher capacity nodes for distributed file querying while avoiding node overload. Third, to reduce file searching delay, PAIS uses proactive file information collection so that a file requester can know if its requested file is in its nearby nodes. Fourth, to reduce the overhead of the file information collection, PAIS uses bloom filter based file information collection and corresponding distributed file searching. Fifth, to improve the file sharing efficiency, PAIS ranks the bloom filter results in order. Sixth, considering that a recently visited file tends to be visited again, the bloom filter based approach is enhanced by only checking the newly added bloom filter information to reduce file searching delay. Trace-driven experimental results from the real-world PlanetLab testbed demonstrate that PAIS dramatically reduces overhead and enhances the efficiency of file sharing with and without churn. Further, the experimental results show the high effectiveness of the intra-sub-cluster file searching approaches in improving file searching efficiency."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2327033"",""National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1354123,CNS-1254006,CNS-1249603,CNS-1049947,CNS-0917056,CNS-1025652)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823748"",""P2P networks";file sharing system;proximity awareness;file replication;"Bloom filter"",""Peer-to-peer computing";Servers;Indexes;Routing;Topology;Clustering algorithms;"Network topology"","""",""13"","""",""56"",""IEEE"",""30 May 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Furthermore, FTAOA employs passive backup copies overlapping technology and is capable to determinate the mode of backup copies adaptively through scheduling primary copies as early as possible and backup copies as late as possible. To improve resource utilization, we allocate tasks to the nodes with high performance in terms of load, energy consumption, and failure ratio.

Recently, cloud providers have introduced auction-based models which allow users to submit bids for their requested VMs. We address the problem of autonomic VM provisioning and allocation for the auction-based model considering multiple types of resources by designing an approximation mechanism. In addition, the mechanism determines the payment the users have to pay for using the allocated resources. This problem is computationally intractable, and our proposed mechanism is by far the strongest approximation result that can be achieved for this problem. We show that the proposed approximation mechanism is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). Furthermore, our proposed mechanism drives the system into an equilibrium in which the users do not have incentives to manipulate the system by untruthfully reporting their VM bundle requests and valuations.

Also, purely relying on a threshold to detect malicious nodes may make a high-reputed node be reluctant to further increase its reputation in these reputation systems. On the other side, the social network concept of “friendship foster cooperation” can be utilized to alleviate the high overhead in reputation systems. However, the limited number of friends limits the availability of file resources in these approaches. To overcome the drawbacks, we propose a social network based reputation system, namely SocialTrust, that synergistically leverages the social network connections and traditional credit based reputation system to provide efficient reputation management for P2P file sharing. In SocialTrust, each node favors friends for service transactions, which are resulted from both real life acquaintances and online partnerships established between high-reputed and frequently-interacted nodes. When no friends are available for a request, a node chooses the server with the highest reputation. The benefits of friendship and partnership on file sharing and cost saving encourage nodes to be continuously cooperative. Further, SocialTrust considers the number of friends/partners and the reputation of a node in reputation rewarding/punishment in order to realize accurate reputation evaluation. SocialTrust can also prevent certain attacks such as deny of service and collusion.

Cloud computing provides a promising platform to support the addressing of this challenge as it provides a flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable manner at low cost. Some techniques have been developed in recent years for processing sensor data on cloud, such as sensor-cloud. However, these techniques do not provide efficient support on fast detection and locating of errors in big sensor data sets. For fast data error detection in big sensor data sets, in this paper, we develop a novel data error detection approach which exploits the full computation potential of cloud platform and the network feature of WSN. Firstly, a set of sensor data error types are classified and defined. Based on that classification, the network feature of a clustered WSN is introduced and analyzed to support fast error detection and location. Specifically, in our proposed approach, the error detection is based on the scale-free network topology and most of detection operations can be conducted in limited temporal or spatial data blocks instead of a whole big data set.

Cloud computing provides a promising platform to support the addressing of this challenge as it provides a flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable manner at low cost. Some techniques have been developed in recent years for processing sensor data on cloud, such as sensor-cloud. However, these techniques do not provide efficient support on fast detection and locating of errors in big sensor data sets. For fast data error detection in big sensor data sets, in this paper, we develop a novel data error detection approach which exploits the full computation potential of cloud platform and the network feature of WSN. Firstly, a set of sensor data error types are classified and defined. Based on that classification, the network feature of a clustered WSN is introduced and analyzed to support fast error detection and location. Specifically, in our proposed approach, the error detection is based on the scale-free network topology and most of detection operations can be conducted in limited temporal or spatial data blocks instead of a whole big data set. Hence the detection and location process can be dramatically accelerated.

In this paper, we investigate the authentication issues with privacy preservation and non-repudiation in VANETs. We propose a novel framework with preservation and repudiation (ACPN) for VANETs. In ACPN, we introduce the public-key cryptography (PKC) to the pseudonym generation, which ensures legitimate third parties to achieve the non-repudiation of vehicles by obtaining vehicles' real IDs. The self-generated PKCbased pseudonyms are also used as identifiers instead of vehicle IDs for the privacy-preserving authentication, while the update of the pseudonyms depends on vehicular demands. The existing ID-based signature (IBS) scheme and the ID-based online/offline signature (IBOOS) scheme are used, for the authentication between the road side units (RSUs) and vehicles, and the authentication among vehicles, respectively.

CMC requires reports from about half as many nodes as other existing algorithms to determine failures with 100 percent accuracy. Moreover, CMC accomplishes this gain significantly faster (sometimes by two orders of magnitude) than an algorithm that matches its accuracy. When there are fewer positive and negative symptoms at a reporting node, CMC performs much better than existing algorithms.

Bridging this disconnect by manually rewriting source code in parallel is prohibitively expensive. Hence, automatic parallelization is an attractive alternative. We present a method to perform automatic parallelization in a binary rewriter. The input to the binary rewriter is the serial binary executable program and the output is a parallel binary executable. The advantages of parallelization in a binary rewriter versus a compiler include: (i) applicability to legacy binaries whose source is not available"; (ii) applicability to library code that is often distributed only as binary; (iii) usability by end-user of the software; and (iv) applicability to assembly-language programs. Adapting existing parallelizing compiler methods that work on source code to binaries is a significant challenge. This is primarily because symbolic and array index information used by existing parallelizing compilers to take parallelizing decisions is not available from a binary. We show how to adapt existing parallelization methods to binaries without using symbolic and array index information to achieve equivalent source parallelization from binaries. Results using our x86 binary rewriter called SecondWrite are presented in detail for the dense-matrix and regular Polybench benchmark suite. For these, the average speedup from our method for binaries is 27.95X versus 28.22X from source on 24 threads, compared to the input serial binary. Super-linear speedups are possible due to cache optimizations. In addition our results show that our method is robust and has correctly parallelized much larger binaries from the SPEC 2006 and OMP 2001 benchmark suites, totaling over 2 million source lines of code (SLOC). Good speedups result on the subset of those benchmarks that have affine parallelism in them;" this subset exceeds 100,000 SLOC.

We present a universal swarming model where the chunks are distributed along different Steiner trees rooted at the source and covering all the receivers. We assume chunks arrive dynamically at the sources and focus on finding stable universal swarming algorithms. To achieve the throughput region, universal swarming usually involves a tree-selection subproblem of finding a min-cost Steiner tree, which is NP-hard. We propose a universal swarming scheme that employs an approximate tree-selection algorithm. We show that it achieves network stability for a reduced throughput region, where the reduction ratio is no more than the approximation ratio of the tree-selection algorithm. We propose a second universal swarming scheme that employs a randomized tree-selection algorithm. It achieves the throughput region, but with a weaker stability result.

In this paper, we develop a new localization protocol based on approximate convex decomposition (ACDL), with reliance on network connectivity information only. ACDL can calculate the node virtual locations for a large-scale sensor network with a complex shape. We first examine one representative localization algorithm and study the influential factors on the localization accuracy, including the sharpness of the angle at the concave point and the depth of the concave valley. We show that after decomposition, the depth of the concave valley becomes irrelevant. We thus define the concavity according to the angle at a concave point, which reflects the localization error. We then propose ACDL protocol for network localization. It consists of four main steps. First, convex and concave nodes are recognized and network boundaries are segmented. As the sensor network is discrete, we show that it is acceptable to approximately identify the concave nodes to control the localization error. Second, an approximate convex decomposition is conducted. Our convex decomposition requires only local information and we show that it has low message overhead. Third, for each convex section of the network, an improved MDS algorithm is proposed to compute a relative location map. Fourth, a fast and low complexity merging algorithm is developed to construct the global location map. Besides, by slight modification on the third step, we propose a variant of ACDL, denoted by ACDL-Tri, which is fully distributed and scalable while the localization accuracy is still comparable. We finally show the efficiency of ACDL by extensive simulations."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2383031"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China and Microsoft Research Asia(grant numbers:60933012)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61073147,61173120,61202460,61271226); National Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2011CDB044); Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (State Education Ministry); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:NCET-10-408); Hong Kong PolyU(grant numbers:A-PJ19,A-PK95,A-PL23); RGC; GRF PolyU(grant numbers:5305/08E);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000585"",""Localization";approximate convex decomposition;wireless sensor networks;Localization;approximate convex decomposition;"wireless sensor networks"",""Approximation algorithms";Wireless sensor networks;Euclidean distance;"Complexity theory"","""",""13"","""",""31"",""IEEE"",""31 Dec 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We introduce a new quality metric, AREA, for schedules that execute computations having interdependent constituent chores (jobs, tasks, etc.) on such platforms. AREA measures the average number of chores that a schedule renders eligible for execution at each step of a computation. Even though the definition of AREA does not mention any properties of host platforms (such as volatility), intuition suggests that rendering chores eligible at a faster rate will have a benign impact on the performance of volatile platforms. We report on simulation experiments that support this intuition. Earlier work has derived the basic properties of the AREA metric and has shown how to efficiently craft AREA-maximizing (A-M) schedules for several classes of significant computations. Even though A-M schedules always exist for every computation, it is not always known how to derive such schedules efficiently. In response, the current study develops an efficient algorithm that produces AREA-Oriented (A-O) schedules, which aim to efficiently approximate the AREAs of A-M schedules on arbitrary computations. The simulation experiments reported on here suggest that, in common with A-M schedules, A-O schedules complete computations on volatile heterogeneous platforms faster than a variety of heuristics that range from lightweight ones to computationally intensive ones-albeit not to the same degree as A-M schedules do. Our experiments suggest that schedules having larger AREAs have smaller completion times-but no proof of that yet exists."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2346189"",""US NSF(grant numbers:CSR-1217981)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873341"",""Scheduling for dynamically heterogeneous platforms";dag scheduling;Cloud computing;Volunteer computing;"Desktop grids"",""Schedules";Computational modeling;Processor scheduling;Dynamic scheduling;Program processors;Measurement;"Reliability"","""",""13"","""",""44"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, determining objective rating scores of products or services becomes a very important yet difficult problem. Existing solutions are mostly majority based, also employing temporal analysis and clustering techniques. However, they are still vulnerable to sophisticated collaborative attacks. In this paper we propose an iterative rating algorithm which is very robust against collusion attacks as well as random and biased raters. Unlike previous iterative methods, our method is not based on comparing submitted evaluations to an approximation of the final rating scores, and it entirely decouples credibility assessment of the cast evaluations from the ranking itself. This makes it more robust against sophisticated collusion attacks than the previous iterative filtering algorithms. We provide a rigorous proof of convergence of our algorithm based on the existence of a fixed point of a continuous mapping which also happens to be a stationary point of a constrained optimization objective. We have implemented and tested our rating method using both simulated data as well as real world movie rating data. Our tests demonstrate that our model calculates realistic rating scores even in the presence of massive collusion attacks and outperforms well-known algorithms in the area. The results of applying our algorithm on the real-world data obtained from MovieLens conforms highly with the rating scores given by Rotten Tomatoes movie critics as domain experts for movies."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.215"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762988"",""Online rating";voting;collusion;iterative method;"trust"",""Communities";Nominations and elections;Motion pictures;Robustness;Iterative methods;Mathematical model;"Accuracy"","""",""36"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""11 Mar 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We consider $n$  locations in a one-dimension network and investigate two cases, i.e., full-range locations where nodes situated have the capability to shuffle throughout the network and long-range locations where nodes are allowed to move to positions nearby within a certain range. In the former situation, with the exact expressions derived, we find location heterogeneity has a critical impact on the first hitting time of random walk, varying from  $\Theta (n)$  to $\Theta \left(n^3\right)$  according to different extent of heterogeneity. The result covers, as two special cases, both the classic independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) mobility and traditional random walk when varying the number of full-range locations. In the latter one, our asymptotic results on both the first crossing time and cover time suggest that they are inversely proportional to the range of neighboring region $r$  ( $\propto r^{-2}$  and $\propto r^{-1}$ , respectively). Furthermore, with multiple concurrent random walks introduced, the first hitting time can be drastically decreased and the effect is strengthened if combined with location heterogeneity. In addition, our investigation into the stationary distribution of nodes indicates that the uniformity no longer holds due to different transition probabilities, as a result of location heterogeneity. We also conduct extensive simulation results to verify our observations and enhance the understanding on the impact of network parameters.

For this purpose, a number of active randomized testing schedulers have been developed to trigger them, and yet pervious experiments show that their deadlock confirmation probability can be low. This paper presents ASN, a novel barrier-based randomized scheduler that triggers real deadlocks with high probabilities. We exploit the insights that in a confirmation run, the threads involved in a real deadlock should properly acquire one or more sets of locks prior to deadlocking. ASN automatically identifies three interesting sets of such positions. It guides the threads participating in a given warning to stay at these position sets in turn. When all the threads are staying at the last position set, ASN checks whether any deadlock that matches with the given warning has been triggered. We have evaluated ASN on 15 deadlock bugs in a suite of real-world multithreaded programs. The results show that ASN either confirms more deadlocks from the benchmark suite or triggers the same deadlocks with significantly higher probabilities than existing schedulers."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307864"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747310"",""Debugging";deadlock triggering;randomized testing;"large-scale multithreaded programs"",""System recovery";Schedules;Computer bugs;Message systems;Monitoring;Testing;"Instruction sets"","""",""15"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""24 Feb 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has been observed that changing the cloud I/O system configurations, such as choices of file systems, number of I/O servers and their placement strategies, etc., will lead to a considerable variation in the performance and cost efficiency of I/O intensive parallel applications. However, storage system configuration is tedious and error-prone to do manually, even for expert users, leading to solutions that are grossly over-provisioned (low cost inefficiency), substantially under-performing (poor performance) or, in the worst case, both.

ACIC takes advantage of machine learning models to perform performance/cost predictions. To tackle the high-dimensional parameter exploration space, we enable affordable, reusable, and incremental training on cloud platforms, guided by the Plackett and Burman Matrices for experiment design. Our evaluation results with four representative parallel applications indicate that ACIC consistently identifies optimal or near-optimal configurations among a large group of candidate settings. The top ACIC-recommended configuration is capable of improving the applications' performance by a factor of up to 10.5 (3.1 on average), and cost saving of up to 89 percent (51 percent on average), compared with a commonly used baseline I/O configuration.

In the OpCut switch, to ensure in-order transmission, only optical Head-of-Line (HOL) packet of a switch flow, i.e., the stream of packets sharing the same input and output port, is allowed to cut-through the switch, and optical HOL packets are always prioritized over buffered HOL packets to achieve high cut-through ratio, which is measured by the portion of packets cutting through the switch optically. However, under such priority rule, switch flows with buffered packets are at the risk of starvation, and the OpCut switch fails to achieve 100 percent throughput for all admissible i.i.d. traffics due to the unfairness in packet scheduling. To address this two issues, in this paper we propose a delay threshold rule for packet scheduling, in which buffered packets with delays exceeding a preset delay threshold are prioritized over optical packets. In the meanwhile, the cut-through ratio is very low under heavily congested traffic due to maintaining packet order, whereas the Internet is designed to accommodate a certain degree of packet reorder, which is very common in practice due to path multiplicity. In this paper, we design a bounded-reorder packet scheduling algorithm that significantly increases the cut-through ratio of the OpCut switch while allowing a small degree of out-of-order transmission. Our extensive simulation results show that the energy efficiency of OpCut switch can be significantly improved with only a very small degree of packet reordering, which has little adverse impact on the network application performance."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2363668"",""US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-0915823)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928510"",""OpCut switch";Energy efficiency;O/E/O conversion;Cut-through ratio;Delay threshold;Reorder bound;Packet scheduling;100% throughput;OpCut switch;energy efficiency;O/E/O conversion;cut-through ratio;delay threshold;reorder bound;packet scheduling;"100% throughput"",""Optical switches";Optical buffering;Optical packet switching;Optical transmitters;Scheduling algorithms;"Optical receivers"","""",""5"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""17 Oct 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We investigate sensor calibration in monitoring pollution sources, without explicit calibration process in uncooperative environment. We leverage the opportunity in sensing diversity, where a participant will sense multiple pollution sources when roaming in the area. Further, inspired by expectation maximization (EM) method, we propose a two-level iterative algorithm to estimate the source presences, source parameters and sensor noise iteratively. The key insight is that, only based on the participatory observations, we can “calibrate sensors without explicit or cooperative calibrating process”. Theoretical analysis proves that, our method can converge to the optimal estimation of sensor noise, where the likelihood of observations is maximized.

Apparently, selfishness has a profound influence on routing efficiency, and thus novel mechanisms are necessary to improve routing performance when self-centered nodes are considered. We first put forward a stateless approach to measure encounter opportunities between nodes, and represent forwarding capabilities of nodes by combining the acquired encounter opportunities with node selfishness. We then quantify receiving capabilities of nodes based on their available buffer size and energy. Taking both forwarding and receiving capabilities into account, we finally present a forwarding set mechanism, which could be deduced to a multiple knapsack problem to maximize the forwarding profit. Consequently, we take all the above studies into the design of a context-aware message forwarding algorithm (CAMF).

One distinct feature of these algorithms is that they do not require explicit identification of individual tags and therefore can eliminate the latency bottleneck caused by serialization during multiple access control. However, these algorithms all assume reliable communications between the reader and the tags. While this assumption is also adopted by many tag-identification protocols in the current RFID standards, it is practically unachievable given the current technology and low-cost requirement of RFID tags. In fact, recent empirical studies have found that the communication between an RFID reader and a set of seemingly “in-range” tags are still unreliable and highly non-deterministic due to the varying channel conditions. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance analysis of a set of channel-oblivious RFID counting algorithms which can estimate the size of a tag-set of interest over unreliable wireless channels. The proposed schemes can provide accurate cardinality estimates without any prior knowledge of the channel parameters. We first propose a series of algorithms and analyze their performance under a simplified memoryless lossy channel model. We then extend them to handle the impact due to backscattering effects and correlated losses found in practical RFID systems.

This paper presents a systematic procedure to select this algorithmic parameter k, which provides communication-computation tradeoff on hardware accelerators like FPGA and GPU. We provide predictive models to understand this tradeoff and show how careful selection of k can lead to performance improvement that otherwise demands significant increase in memory bandwidth. On an Nvidia C2050 GPU, we demonstrate a 1.9×-42.6× speedup over standard iterative solvers for a range of benchmarks and that this speedup is limited by the growth in redundant computation.

The goal is to develop communication-efficient algorithms that are scalable to the network size. Exploiting the sparse nature of the events, we formulate the event monitoring task as an `1 regularized nonnegative least squares problem where the optimization variable is a sparse vector representing the locations and magnitudes of events. Traditionally the problem can be reformulated by letting each sensor hold a local copy of the event vector and imposing consensus constraints on the local copies, and solved by decentralized algorithms such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This technique requires each sensor to exchange their estimates of the entire sparse vector and hence leads to high communication cost. Motivated by the observation that an event usually has limited influence range, we develop two communication-efficient decentralized algorithms, one is the partial consensus algorithm and the other is the Jacobi approach. In the partial consensus algorithm that is based on the ADMM, each sensor is responsible for recovering those events relevant to itself, and hence only consent with neighboring nodes on a part of the sparse vector. This strategy greatly reduces the amount of information exchanged among sensors. The Jacobi approach addresses the case that each sensor cares about the event occurring at its own position. Jacobi-like iterates are shown to be much faster than other algorithms, and incur minimal communication cost per iteration. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate the importance of proper modelling in designing communication-efficient decentralized algorithms."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2350474"",""NSFC(grant numbers:61004137)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881722"",""Wireless sensor network (WSN)";event monitoring;"decentralized computation"",""Monitoring";Wireless sensor networks;Optimization;Vectors;Sensors;Jacobian matrices;"Noise measurement"","""",""10"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""21 Aug 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper considers a mobile computation offloading problem where multiple mobile services in workflows can be invoked to fulfill their complex requirements and makes decision on whether the services of a workflow should be offloaded. Due to the mobility of portable devices, unstable connectivity of mobile networks can impact the offloading decision. To address this issue, we propose a novel offloading system to design robust offloading decisions for mobile services. Our approach considers the dependency relations among component services and aims to optimize execution time and energy consumption of executing mobile services. To this end, we also introduce a mobility model and a trade-off fault-tolerance mechanism for the offloading system. A genetic algorithm (GA) based offloading method is then designed and implemented after carefully modifying parts of a generic GA to match our special needs for the stated problem.

Optimizing the use of duplication with MIP provides both energy efficiency and performance by reducing the communication energy consumption and the communication latency. The contention awareness gives a more accurate estimation of the energy consumption.

First, our static schemes utilize two approaches with contention awareness to obtain the mapping of tasks to cores together with scheduling of communications on NoC for minimizing makespan, and thus can potentially lower uniform scaled frequency for cores and links while meeting the timeliness. Next, different from other existing schemes, by incorporating the latency due to network congestions into the analysis, our dynamic contention-aware energy management schemes perform the allocation of feasible slack to tasks and communications simultaneously for further energy savings, subject to common voltage and frequency limitations of VFI and timing constraints of task set. The results through extensive simulations and case studies show that, compared to heuristicbased and INLP-based task mapping solutions (with pessimistic estimation of communication contention), our static scheme can obtain better energy savings (e.g., 25 percent more). The results also show that our dynamic scheme can save up to 45 percent more energy compared to our static scheme under deadline guarantee, while the online scheme ignoring the traffic congestions in NoC can result in serious deadline violation and usually more energy consumption (e.g., 15 percent more)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307866"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6774493"",""Real-time systems";energy savings;multi/many core processors;Network-on-Chip (NoC);communication contention;voltage frequency island (VFI);"dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS)"",""Multicore processing";Energy management;Real-time systems;Routing;Program processors;"Optical switches"","""",""27"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""17 Mar 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We develop a RUN framework to model the cost of providing forwarding services and the utility obtained by gaining services. The objective of the RUN is to maximize the total Quality of Cooperation (QoC) of users in the RUN. Two optimal bandwidth allocation schemes are proposed for both free and dynamic bandwidth demand models.

We prove that the problems under both the single relay and the multi-relay scenario are NP-hard. Three heuristic algorithms are proposed to deal with bandwidth allocation and relay-client association.

Several methods to refine the location estimation are discussed, which include the adjustment of trajectory based on reference points and the mutual refinement of location estimation for encountering nodes based on maximum-likelihood. To track user movement, the proposed ProbTracking method uses Markov chain to describe movement patterns and determines the most possible user walking trajectories without full record of user locations.

The main issue is to best utilize the cloud as well as the application provider's existing private cloud, to serve volatile requests with service response time guarantee at all times, while incurring the minimum operational cost. While it may not be too difficult to design a simple heuristic, proposing one with guaranteed cost optimality over a long run of the system constitutes an intimidating challenge. Employing Lyapunov optimization techniques, we design a dynamic control algorithm to optimally place contents and dispatch requests in a hybrid cloud infrastructure spanning geo-distributed data centers, which minimizes overall operational cost overtime, subject to service response time constraints. Rigorous analysis shows that the algorithm nicely bounds the response times within the preset QoS target, and guarantees that the overall cost is within a small constant gap from the optimum achieved by a T-slot lookahead mechanism with known future information.

Most of existing mobile sensing applications consider users reporting and accessing sensing data through the Internet. However, this approach cannot be applied in the scenarios with poor network coverage or expensive network access. Existing data forwarding schemes for mobile opportunistic networks are not sufficient for sensing applications as spatial-temporal correlation among sensory data has not been explored. In order to build sensing maps satisfying specific sensing quality with low delay and energy consumption, we design COUPON, a novel cooperative sensing and data forwarding framework. We first notice that cooperative sensing scheme can eliminate sampling redundancy and hence save energy. Then we design two cooperative forwarding schemes by leveraging data fusion: Epidemic Routing with Fusion (ERF) and Binary Spray-and-Wait with Fusion (BSWF). Different from previous work assuming that all packets are propagated independently, we consider that packets are spatial-temporal correlated in the forwarding process, and derive the dissemination law of correlated packets.

Each sensor node independently computes and stores a random projection of the sensed data, such that a mobile sink can recover the data with high probability after visiting a small and random portion of the network. As a prerequisite of distributed CS encoding, sensor readings from all nodes are disseminated within the network through random walk. Therefore, the CS measurement matrix depends heavily on how the random walk is performed. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis on the interplay between random walk parameters and sensing data characteristics, and derive the conditions in successful CS data recovery. In addition, we discover that there is a trade-off between the number of random walk instances and steps in order to achieve the required data persistence performance.

Existing iSCSI leverages the OS page cache to ensure data sharing and reuse. However, the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture introduces another dimension of complexity, i.e., asymmetric memory access in multi-core and many-core platforms. Within a NUMA platform, an iSCSI target often dispatches an access request with a cache hit to an I/O thread remote to cached data, and thus cannot fully utilize multi-core systems. We encounter this problem in the context of ultra high-speed data transfer between two iSCSI storage systems, during which inferior NUMA remote memory access lags behind available high network bandwidth, and thereby becomes a bottleneck of the entire end-to-end data transfer path. We design a NUMA-aware cache mechanism to align cache memory with local NUMA nodes and threads, and then schedule I/O requests to those threads that are local to the data being accessed. This NUMA-aware solution results in lower access latency and higher system throughput. We implement a cache system within the Linux SCSI target framework, and evaluated it on our NUMA-based iSCSI testbed.

This results in either redundant information which might pose high communication burden on WSNs, or incomplete information for root-cause inference that leads false judgments. To address the issue, we propose DID, a directional diagnosis approach, in which the diagnosis information acquirement is guided by the fault inference process.

In this paper, we propose deliberate synchronized constructive interference (Disco), which ensures concurrent transmissions of an identical packet to synchronize more precisely than traditional CI. Disco envisions concurrent transmissions to positively interfere at the receiver, and potentially allows orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and improvements in link quality. We also theoretically introduce a sufficient condition to construct Disco with IEEE 802.15.4 radio for the first time. Moreover, we propose Triggercast, a distributed middleware service, and show it is feasible to generate Disco on real sensor network platforms like TMote Sky. To synchronize transmissions of multiple senders at the chip level, Triggercast effectively compensates propagation and radio processing delays, and has 95th percentile synchronization errors of at most 250 ns.

Different from other applications of WSNs such as environmental monitoring, SHM applications are much more data intensive and it is not feasible to stream the raw data back to the server due to the severe bandwidth and energy limitations of low-power sensor networks. In-network processing is a promising approach to address this problem but designing distributed versions for the sophisticated SHM algorithms is much more challenging because SHM algorithms are computationally intensive, and involve data-level collaboration of multiple sensors. In this paper, we select a classical SHM algorithm: the eigen-system realization algorithm (ERA), and propose a few distributed ERAs suitable for WSNs. In particular, we first design a method to incrementally calculate the ERA and then propose three schemes upon which the incremental ERA can be carried out along an Hamiltonian path, along a path in the minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) and along the shortest path tree (SPT).

First, we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility-customer interaction consisting of sub-components of customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing and demand response (DR). Within this hierarchical architecture, we focus on the problem of real-time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units. A scalable solution to the real-time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub-problems: (1) centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro-grid and (2) distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions. We formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP). Next, a Vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart-homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions. We show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart-homes in the auctioning game, collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation. Analysis on the structure of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set shows that the Vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers (anticipating distributed smart-homes) by introducing a positive reserve price. The corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding Bayesian Nash equilibrium, without jeopardizing the auctioneer's (microgrid controller's) profit. The paper also explicitly discusses how this two-step solution approach can be scaled to be suitable for more complicated smart grid architectures beyond the assumed abstract model."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308204"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748053"",""Bayesian Nash equilibria";hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP);hierarchical architecture;microgrid;resource pooling;smart-home;truthful bidding strategy;utility-customer interaction;"Vickrey auction"",""Microgrids";Smart grids;Real-time systems;Decision making;Planning;Games;"Load modeling"","""",""53"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""25 Feb 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, to avoid the requirement of location information, we define topological convex hull (T-convex hull) which presents the convex contour of an event region directly with a route passing by nodes, and hence becomes more efficient in handling the above tasks. To obtain the T-convex hull of event region in the absence of locations, we propose a low-weight (in terms of computation and storage resource requirement) distributed algorithm, with which sensor nodes just need to count the hop counts from some nodes.

In this paper, we introduce the DANBI programming model, which supports irregular stream programs, and propose dynamic scheduling techniques. Scheduling irregular stream programs is very challenging, and the load imbalance becomes a major hurdle to achieving scalability. Our dynamic load-balancing scheduler exploits producer-consumer relationships already expressed in the DANBI program to achieve scalability. Moreover, it effectively avoids the thundering-herd problem and dynamically adapts to load imbalance in a probabilistic manner. It surpasses prior static stream scheduling approaches which are vulnerable to load imbalance and also surpasses prior dynamic stream scheduling approaches which result in many restrictions on supported program types, on the scope of dynamic scheduling, and on data ordering preservation. Our experimental results on a 40-core server show that DANBI achieves an almost linear scalability and outperforms state-of-the-art parallel runtimes by up to 2.8 times."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2325833"",""National Research Foundation of Korea"; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Plannig(grant numbers:2010-0020730);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824243"",""Stream programming";software pipelining;scheduling;load balancing;"irregular programs"",""Kernel";Dynamic scheduling;Scalability;Runtime;Programming;Parallel processing;"Schedules"","""",""5"","""",""45"",""IEEE"",""2 Jun 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, at high load, congestion and its negative effects (e.g., Head-of-line blocking) threaten the performance of the network, and so the one of the entire system. Congestion control (CC) is crucial to ensure an efficient utilization of the interconnection network during congestion situations. As one major trend is to reduce the effective wiring in interconnection networks to reduce cost and power consumption, the network will operate very close to its capacity. Thus, congestion control becomes essential. Existing CC techniques can be divided into two general approaches. One is to throttle traffic injection at the sources that contribute to congestion, and the other is to isolate the congested traffic in specially designated resources. However, both approaches have different, but non-overlapping weaknesses: injection throttling techniques have a slow reaction against congestion, while isolating traffic in special resources may lead the system to run out of those resources. In this paper we propose EcoCC, a new Efficient and Cost-Effective CC technique, that combines injection throttling and congested-flow isolation to minimize their respective drawbacks and maximize overall system performance. This new strategy is suitable for current commercial switch architectures, where it could be implemented without requiring significant complexity. Experimental results, using simulations under synthetic and real trace-based traffic patterns, show that this technique improves by up to 55 percent over some of the most successful congestion control techniques."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307851"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747321"",""Interconnection networks";congestion control;head-of-line blocking;"injection throttling"",""Switches";Ports (Computers);Computer aided manufacturing;Multiprocessor interconnection;"Complexity theory"","""",""20"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""24 Feb 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Prior techniques of temporal multitasking can be employed with GPU resources as well, but not all GPU kernels make full use of the GPU resources. There is, therefore, an unmet need for spatial multitasking in GPUs. Resources used inefficiently by one kernel can be instead assigned to another kernel that can more effectively use the resources.

Available data services may participate in an election to choose the service that would execute each task. During task scheduling, each candidate service commits itself to satisfy some requirements or to finish a task execution by a certain time, depending on the task's execution objective. In order to achieve high performance while still satisfying specified requirements, the election mechanism combines two reputation models: one classifies candidate services over their dependability (qualitative perspective), while the other is used to build expectations on a task's execution time (quantitative perspective). Candidate classification mechanisms, recall elections and reelections rules are used to prevent performance or dependability degradation by the presence of malicious or erroneous services.

We demonstrate a distributed market for potential sellers to flexibly and adaptively determine their resource prices through a repeated seller competition game.

However, virtual machines (VMs) running on the same physical GPU with virtualization technology are correlated, because the change of GPU frequencies will affect the SLA performance of all the VMs. In fact, both reducing power consumption and guaranteeing SLA should work together under the considerations of their correlations. This paper proposes a novel two-layer control architecture called energy-efficient SLA guarantees for virtualized GPU (EvGPU) based on well-established feedback control techniques. The first control loop adopts a proportional-integral (PI) controller to ensure SLA guarantees, which in particular are measured at a predefined level of the frames per second (FPS) for each online game. The secondary power control loop then adjusts GPU frequency through dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) to reduce power consumption based on the current FPS achieved by the first loop.

Results show the viability of our pulsing algorithm in determining a base replication level. Next, a Markovian queueing model is introduced, allowing us to induce replication based on the required speed of service. This affords finer control over the replication process, creating a more effective replication strategy suited for mobile-based CDNs. Extensive analysis of the model were performed, with parameters derived from real-world conditions. Results indicate that the model is able to compute logical values for the expected waiting times in service and thus, control the speed of replication within the CDN."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.2297927"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863686"",""Content delivery networks";availability;"replication"",""Availability";Radiation detectors;Servers;Wireless communication;Peer-to-peer computing;"Mobile communication"","""",""13"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""24 Jul 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We present a novel distributed algorithm for estimating and tracking the local evolution characteristics of continuous objects. The hazard's front line is approximated as a set of line segments, and the spatiotemporal evolution of each segment is modeled by a small number of parameters (orientation, direction and speed of motion). As the hazard approaches, these parameters are re-estimated using ad-hoc clusters (triplets) of collaborating sensor nodes. Parameters updating is based on algebraic closed-form expressions resulting from the analytical solution of a Bayesian estimation problem. Therefore, it can be implemented by microprocessors of the WSN nodes, while respecting their limited processing capabilities and strict energy constraints. Extensive computer simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed distributed algorithm to estimate accurately the evolution characteristics of complex hazard fronts under different conditions by using reasonably dense WSNs. The proposed in-network processing scheme does not require sensor node clocks synchronization and is shown to be robust to sensor node failures and communication link failures, which are expected in harsh environments."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2357033"",""GSRT";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6895267"",""Environmental hazard";continuous object;predictive modeling;distributed estimation;Bayesian estimation;"wireless sensor networks"",""Silicon";Hazards;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Mathematical model;Probabilistic logic;"Uncertainty"","""",""11"","""",""34"",""OAPA"",""11 Sep 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To lower down the network traffic and efficiently use the available network bandwidth, we propose to push the aggregation computation into the network and parallelize the shuffle and reduce phases. In this paper, we first examine the gain and feasibility of the in-network aggregation with BCube, a novel server-centric networking structure for future data centers. To exploit such a gain, we model the in-network aggregation problem that is NP-hard in BCube. We propose two approximate methods for building the efficient IRS-based incast aggregation tree and SRS-based shuffle aggregation subgraph, solely based on the labels of their members and the data center topology. We further design scalable forwarding schemes based on Bloom filters to implement in-network aggregation over massive concurrent shuffle transfers. Based on a prototype and large-scale simulations, we demonstrate that our approaches can significantly decrease the amount of network traffic and save the data center resources.

Moreover, the recursive tree search algorithms often fail with large indexes because of the GPU's tiny runtime stack size. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel tree traversal algorithm-massively parallel restart scanning (MPRS) for multi-dimensional range queries that avoids recursion and irregular memory access. The proposed MPRS algorithm traverses hierarchical tree structures with mostly contiguous memory access patterns without recursion, which offers more chances to optimize the parallel SIMD algorithm.

The traditional synchronous encodingprocess neither leverages the existence of replicas, nor handles encoding operations in a decentralized manner. To overcome these drawbacks, we exploit pipelined encoding processes to boost the data archival performance on storage clusters. First, we propose two data layouts called [D + P]cd and [3X]cd by applying a chained-declustering mechanism to both Mirrored RAID-5 and triplication redundancy groups. Second, in light of the [D + P]cd and [3X]cd layouts, we design two archiving schemes named DP and 3X, which exhibit the following three salient features: (i) exploiting data locality-two or three local blocks are read by each involved node for encoding; (ii) decentralized computation load-encoding operations are distributed among k nodes; and (iii) parallel archival processing-two or three encoding pipelines are simultaneously deployed to generate parity blocks. We implement both the DPand 3X schemes and three existing solutions (i.e., SynE, DE, and RapidRAID) in a real-world storage cluster. Experimental results show that our archival schemes outperform the other three solutions in terms of archiving time by a factor of at least 3.41 in a nine-node storage cluster.

Fault tolerant methods attempt to reduce the expected execution time by allowing recovery from failure. This paper presents an analysis and implementation of a fault tolerant Cholesky factorization algorithm that does not require checkpointing for recovery from fail-stop failures. Rather, this algorithm uses redundant data added in an additional set of processes. This differs from previous works with algorithmic methods as it addresses fail-stop failures rather than fail-continue cases. The proposed fault tolerance scheme is incorporated into ScaLAPACK and validated on the supercomputer Kraken.

Fault tolerance can be implemented through scheduling approaches. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to fault-tolerant scheduling on satellites. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic fault-tolerant scheduling model for real-time tasks running on multiple observation satellites. In this model, the primary-backup policy is employed to tolerate one satellite's permanent failure at one time instant. In the light of the fault-tolerant model, we develop a novel fault-tolerant satellite scheduling algorithm named FTSS. To improve the resource utilization, we apply the overlapping technology that includes primary-backup copy overlapping (i.e., PB overlapping) and backup-backup copy overlapping (i.e., BB overlapping). According to the satellites characterized with time windows for observations, we extensively analyze the overlapping mechanism on satellites. We integrate the overlapping mechanism with FTSS, which employs the task merging strategies including primary-backup copy merging (i.e., PB merging), backup-backup copy merging (i.e., BB merging) and primary-primary copy merging (i.e., PP merging). These merging strategies are used to decrease the number of tasks required to be executed, thereby enhancing system schedulability. To demonstrate the superiority of our FTSS, we conduct extensive experiments using the real-world satellite parameters supplied from the satellite tool kit or STK";" we compare FTSS with the three baseline algorithms, namely, NMFTSS, NOFTSS, and NMNOFTSS.

It differs from conventional approaches, and relies on a novel method of co-designing the last level cache and the network on chip. We artificially constrain the communication pattern in the NUCA cache such that all the messages travel along a few predefined paths (fast paths) for each set of banks. We leverage this communication pattern by designing a new type of NOC router called the Freeze router, which augments a regular router by adding a layer of circuitry that gates the clock of the regular router when there is a fast path message waiting to be transmitted. Messages along the fast path do not require buffering, switching, or routing. We incorporate a bank predictor with our novel NOC for reducing the number of messages, and resultant energy consumption. We compare our performance with state of the art protocols, and report speedups of up to 31 percent (mean: 6.3 percent), and ED2 reduction up to 46 percent (mean: 10.4 percent) for a suite of Splash and Parsec benchmarks.

The strategy is to force the equally-weighted applications to bear the same amount of slowdown when they run concurrently. When we find an application suffered more slowdown and accumulated less effective work than others, we allocate more CPU time to give it a better parity. This policy can also be applied to threads with different weights. Evaluation results show that FPS can significantly improve system fairness at the expense of a slight loss in throughput.

While the dedicated Congestion Propagation Network (CPN) helps routers to make promising routing decisions, it incurs additional wiring and power costs and becomes an unnecessary decoration when the load of NoC is light. Moreover, the CPN has to be extended if one would utilize more sophisticated congestion information to enhance the performance of NoC, bringing in even larger wiring and power costs. This paper proposes an innovative non-local adaptive routing technique called FreeRider, which does not use a dedicated CPN but instead leverages free bits in head flits of existing packets to carry and propagate rich congestion information without introducing additional wires or flits. In order to balance the network load, FreeRider adopts a novel three-stage strategy of output link selection, which adequately utilizes the propagated information to make routing decisions.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of load distribution for real-time traffic over multipath networks. Due to the path diversity and unreliability in heterogeneous overlay networks, large end-to-end delay and consecutive packet losses can significantly degrade the traffic flow's goodput, whereas existing studies mainlyfocus on the delay or throughput performance. To address the challenging problems, we propose a Goodput-Aware Load distribuTiON (GALTON) model that includes three phases: (1) path status estimation to accurately sense the quality of each transport link, (2) flow rate assignment to optimize the aggregate goodput of input traffic, and (3) deadline-constrained packet interleaving to mitigate consecutive losses. We present a mathematical formulation for multipath load distribution and derive the solution based on utility theory. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through semi-physical emulations in Exata involving both real Internet traffic traces and H.264 video streaming.

SCAN is a fast and efficient clustering technique for finding hidden communities and isolating hubs/outliers within a network. However, for very large networks, it still takes considerable amount of time. With the introduction of massively parallel Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) by Nvidia, applications properly employing GPUs are demonstrating high speed up. In current study, GPUSCAN, a CUDA based parallel implementation of SCAN, is presented. SCAN's computation steps have been carefully redesigned to run very efficiently on the GPU by transforming SCAN into a series of highly regular and independent concurrent operations. All intermediate data structures are created in the GPU to efficiently benefit from GPU's memory hierarchy. How these structures reformed and represented in the GPU memory hierarchy are illustrated. Now, through GPUSCAN, a large network or a batch of disjoint networks can be offloaded to the GPU for very fast and equivalent structural clustering. The performance of the GPU accelerated structural clustering has been shown to be much faster than the sequential CPU implementation. Both GPUSCAN and SCAN are tested on different size artificial and real-world networks. Results indicate that network becomes larger GPUSCAN significantly over performs SCAN. In tested datasets, speed-up of over 500-fold is achieved. For instance, calculating structural similarity and clustering of 5.5 million edges of the California road network in GPUSCAN is 513-fold faster than the serial version of SCAN."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2374607"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967853"",""structural clustering for networks";GPGPU;high-performance computing;very large networks;social networks;Structural clustering for networks;GPGPU;high-performance computing;very large networks;"social networks"",""Graphics processing units";Clustering algorithms;Instruction sets;"Algorithm design and analysis"","""",""13"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""26 Nov 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is well recognized that event matching is a fundamental component of such large-scale systems. Event matching searches a space which is composed of all subscriptions. As the scale and complexity of a system grows, the efficiency of event matching becomes more critical to system performance. However, most existing methods suffer significant performance degradation when the system has large numbers of both subscriptions and their component constraints. In this paper, we present Hash Tree (H-Tree), a highly efficient index structure for event matching. H-Tree is a hash table in nature that is a combination of hash lists and hash chaining. A hash list is built up on an indexed attribute by realizing novel overlapping divisions of the attribute's value domain, providing more efficient space consumption. Multiple hash lists are then combined into a hash tree. The basic idea behind H-Tree is that matching efficiencies are improved when the search space is substantially reduced by pruning most of the subscriptions that are not matched. We have implemented H-Tree and conducted extensive experiments in different settings. Experimental results demonstrate that H-Tree has better performance than its counterparts by a large margin. In particular, the matching speed is faster by three orders of magnitude than its counterparts when the numbers of both subscriptions and their component constraints are huge."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2323262"",""Morgan Stanley(grant numbers:CIP-A20110324-2)"; NSFC(grant numbers:61272438,61170238); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:12511502704); China 973 Program(grant numbers:2014CB340303); Singapore NRF(grant numbers:CREATE E2S2); National 863 Program(grant numbers:2013AA01A601); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(grant numbers:IRT1158);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814863"",""Content-based publish/subscribe";event matching;index structure;performance;"matching time"",""Subscriptions";Indexes;Upper bound;Memory management;Silicon;Field-flow fractionation;"Random variables"","""",""22"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""13 May 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In view of these challenges, we propose a privacy-aware cross-cloud service composition method, named HireSome-II (History record-based Service optimization method) based on its previous basic version HireSome-I. In our method, to enhance the credibility of a composition plan, the evaluation of a service is promoted by some of its QoS history records, rather than its advertised QoS values. Besides, the k-means algorithm is introduced into our method as a data filtering tool to select representative history records. As a result, HireSome-II can protect cloud privacy, as a cloud is not required to unveil all its transaction records. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the time complexity of developing a cross-cloud service composition plan as only representative ones are recruited, which is demanded for big data processing. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the validity of our method compared to a benchmark."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.246"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613488"",""Cloud";service composition;QoS;big data;"transaction history records"",""History";Cloud computing;Quality of service;Information management;Data handling;Data storage systems;"Clustering algorithms"","""",""98"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""27 Sep 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To speed up job execution, MapReduce allows reduce tasks to early fetch their required intermediate data. However, the impact of these policy combinations on the job completion reliability (JCR for short) and job energy consumption (JEC for short) of a MapReduce cluster was not clear, where JCR is the reliability with which a MapReduce job can be completed by the cluster, whereas JEC is the energy consumed by the cluster to complete the job. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the JCR and JEC of a MapReduce cluster on four policy combinations (POCs for short) derived from two typical intermediate-data replication policies and two typical reduce-task assignment policies. The four POCs are further compared in extensive scenarios, which not only consider jobs at different scales with various parameters, but also give a MapReduce cluster two extreme parallel execution capabilities and diverse bandwidths.

We use database transaction processing as a motivating update-intensive workload. Our studies based on a flash disk simulator as well as flash disks show that, these activities result in significant overhead to the I/O response time and system throughput. To resolve the impact of internal activities, we propose dynamic page replications to exploit the multi-chip parallelism on the flash disk. Specifically, we replicate the frequently blocked data pages to improve the data availability even when internal activities block the request. To reduce the overhead of replications, we take advantage of the idle periods in the flash chips for the I/O operations by writes to replicas or reads from replicas, and further develop a prediction model for the decisions on those I/O operations to minimize the interference to normal I/O operations.

Such programs normally run in discrete time-steps or ticks, with simulated space decomposed into domains that are distributed over a set of workers to achieve parallelism. A distinguishing feature of behavioral simulations is their frequent and high-volume group migration, the phenomenon in which simulated objects traverse domains in groups at massive scale in each tick. This results in continual and significant load imbalance among domains. To tackle this problem, traditional load balancing approaches either require excessive load re-profiling and redistribution, which lead to high computation/communication costs, or perform poorly because their statically partitioned data domains cannot reflect load changes brought by group migration. In this paper, we propose an effective and low-cost load balancing scheme, named Inc-part, based on a key observation that an object is unlikely to move a long distance (across many domains) within a single tick. This localized mobility property allows one to efficiently estimate the load of a dynamic domain incrementally, based on merely the load changes occurring in its neighborhood. The domains experiencing significant load changes are then partitioned or merged, and redistributed to redress load imbalance among the workers. Experiments on a 64-node (1,024-core) platform show that Inc-part can attain excellent load balance with dramatically lowered costs compared to state-of-the-art solutions."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2333511"",""China National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:61272408,61322210)"; National High-tech Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2012AA010905); Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:20130142110048); NSFC(grant numbers:61103243,61379135);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844883"",""Behavioral simulation";load balancing;incremental partitioning;multi-agent system;"group migration"",""Load modeling";Context;Load management;Educational institutions;Merging;Biological system modeling;"Partitioning algorithms"","""",""7"","""",""24"",""IEEE"",""26 Jun 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Meanwhile, guaranteeing the freshness of contents is also a big problem for content dissemination in OppNets. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose an incentive-driven and freshness-aware pub/sub Content Dissemination scheme, called ConDis, for selfish OppNets. In ConDis, the Tit-For-Tat (TFT) scheme is employed to deal with selfish behaviors of nodes in OppNets. Moreover, a novel content exchange protocol is proposed when nodes are in contact. Specifically, during each contact, the exchange order is determined by the content utility, which represents the usefulness of a content for a certain node, and the objective of nodes is to maximize the utility of the content inventory stored in their buffer.

We mathematically analyze the root cause of such clock uncertainty and propose a protocol called EATS. Sensor nodes with EATS can intelligently select the best synchronization parents that minimize the negative impact of the energy heterogeneity. The selection is robust to multiple impacting factors in the network and provides fine-grained synchronization accuracy. In addition, nodes can make use of local energy information and further calibrate the clocks.

We focus our study on the feedback control layer as the most time-critical and demanding functionality. Today's large-scale industrial automation projects are expensive and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a new cloud-based automation architecture, and we analyze cost and time savings under the proposed architecture. We show that significant cost and time savings can be achieved, mainly due to the virtualization of controllers and the reduction of hardware cost and associated labor. However, the major difficulties in providing cloud-based industrial automation systems are timeliness and reliability. Offering automation functionalities from the cloud over the Internet puts the controlled processes at risk due to varying communication delays and potential failure of virtual machines and/or links. Thus, we design an adaptive delay compensator and a distributed fault tolerance algorithm to mitigate delays and failures, respectively. We theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed architecture when compared to the traditional systems and prove zero or negligible change in performance. To experimentally evaluate our approach, we implement our controllers on commercial clouds and use them to control: (i) a physical model of a solar power plant, where we show that the fault-tolerance algorithm effectively makes the system unaware of faults, and (ii) industry-standard emulation with large injected delays and disturbances, where we show that the proposed cloud-based controllers perform indistinguishably from the best-known counterparts: local controllers."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2359894"",""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6908023"",""Cloud Computing";Industrial Automation;Delay Compensation;Fault Tolerance;Feedback Control;Cloud computing;industrial automation;delay compensation;fault tolerance;"feedback control"",""Delays";Automation;Process control;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Power generation;"Reliability"","""",""75"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""23 Sep 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is a fundamental issue to find a subset of influential individuals in a mobile social network such that targeting them initially (e.g., to adopt a new product) will maximize the spread of the influence (further adoptions of the new product). The problem of finding the most influential nodes is unfortunately NP-hard.

It encompasses two components: dividing the large-scale mobile social network into several communities by taking into account information diffusion and selecting communities to find influential nodes by a dynamic programming. Then, to further improve the performance, we parallelize the influence propagation based on communities and consider the influence propagation crossing communities. Also, we give precision analysis to show approximation guarantees of our models. Experiments on real large-scale mobile social networks show that the proposed methods are much faster than previous algorithms, meanwhile, with high accuracy."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2320515"",""National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2014AA015103)"; National Science and Technology Support Plan(grant numbers:2014BAG01B02);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805620"",""Mobile social network";influence maximization;greedy algorithm;"divide-and-conquer"",""Communities";Social network services;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Greedy algorithms;Approximation algorithms;"Approximation methods"","""",""90"","""",""44"",""IEEE"",""25 Apr 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the advent of these bandwidth-intensive applications, it is economically inefficient to provide streaming distribution with guaranteed QoS relying only on central resources at a media content provider. Cloud computing offers an elastic infrastructure that media content providers (e.g., Video on Demand (VoD) providers) can use to obtain streaming resources that match the demand. Media content providers are charged for the amount of resources allocated (reserved) in the cloud. Most of the existing cloud providers employ a pricing model for the reserved resources that is based on non-linear time-discount tariffs (e.g., Amazon CloudFront and Amazon EC2). Such a pricing scheme offers discount rates depending non-linearly on the period of time during which the resources are reserved in the cloud. In this case, an open problem is to decide on both the right amount of resources reserved in the cloud, and their reservation time such that the financial cost on the media content provider is minimized. We propose a simple-easy to implement-algorithm for resource reservation that maximally exploits discounted rates offered in the tariffs, while ensuring that sufficient resources are reserved in the cloud. Based on the prediction of demand for streaming capacity, our algorithm is carefully designed to reduce the risk of making wrong resource allocation decisions. The results of our numerical evaluations and simulations show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the monetary cost of resource allocations in the cloud as compared to other conventional schemes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2316827"",""National Center of Electronics, Communication, and Photonics at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787111"",""Media streaming";cloud computing;non-linear pricing models;"network economics"",""Media";Streaming media;Bandwidth;Pricing;Prediction algorithms;Resource management;"Cloud computing"","""",""35"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""11 Apr 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we introduce a different approach using both lock-free techniques and combining techniques synergistically to design a practical and scalable concurrent queue algorithm. As a result, we have achieved high scalability without any parameter tuning: on an 80-thread average throughput in our experimental results, our queue algorithm outperforms the most widely used Michael and Scott queue by 14.3 times, the best-performing combining-based queue by 1.6 times, and the best performing x86-dependent lock-free queue by 1.7 percent. In addition, we designed our algorithm in such a way that the life cycle of a node is the same as that of its element. This has huge advantages over prior work: efficient implementation is possible without dedicated memory management schemes, which are supported only in some languages, may cause a performance bottleneck, or are patented.

To meet requirements of users, smart devices with different kinds of functions may need to be associated together to provide the service described in the user requirement, which is called service composition. As the service composition environment may be dynamic and large scale, centralized service composition algorithm is usually inefficient due to message cost. On the other hand, a decentralized approach, which employs pre-determined coordinators to search and compose service, may have high cost as well. In this paper, we discuss a localized approach for service composition based on the Ubiquitous Interacting Object (UIO) model we have proposed earlier. UIO is an abstraction of physical devices in PvCE with ability to find and collaborate with other devices through exposing their capabilities as services. In our localized service composition algorithm (LASEC), UIOs collaborate with each other in a bottom-up, localized manner to compose required service without requiring global knowledge. To solve the problem of blind compositions in LASEC, we propose a novel mechanism called Alien-information-based Acknowledging (A-Ack), in which a UIO decides on collaborating with another UIO only after obtaining some additional information from the collaboration candidate. Specifically, this information refers to ability of a given UIO to compose another part of the service. Proposed LASEC is message-efficient and quality-guaranteed. Extensive simulations of LASEC as well as existing decentralized and pull-based centralized algorithms have been conducted. The results show the relatively low communication cost and composition time of LASEC.

Various definitions of social similarity have been proposed as the criterion for relay selection, which results in various forwarding schemes. The appropriateness and practicality of various definitions determine the performances of these forwarding schemes. A popular definition has recently been proven to be more efficient than other existing ones, i.e., the more common interests between two nodes, the larger social similarity between them. In this work, we show that schemes based on such definition ignore the fact that members within the same community, i.e., with the same interest, usually have different levels of local activity, which will result in a low efficiency of data delivery. To address this, in this paper, we design a new data forwarding scheme for MSNs based on community detection in dynamic weighted networks, called Local-Activity and Social-Similarity, taking into account the difference of members' internal activity within each community, i.e., local activity. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first one that utilizes different levels of local activity within communities.

Many studies in the literature have addressed the problem of evaluating the performance of a sensor network based on detection probability. However, it is difficult to guarantee detection probability in a sensor network since it depends on the topology of the sensor deployment and the location of the target. A sensor network without a careful sensor location arrangement may experience very low detection probability. This paper integrates collaborative fusion and sequential detection to guarantee the quality of the decisions made by a sensor network and analytically derives the average detection latency based on value fusion and decision fusion. Specifically, sensors periodically report their local measurements or decisions to a fusion center. The fusion center makes final decisions only when both the pre-defined false alarm probability and missing probability are satisfied. Otherwise, it will continue to collect data and repeat the decision making operations. Simple and elegant detection rules are provided for the collaborative sequential detection operations. Extensive simulations are conducted to show the performance of a sensor network in terms of detection latency.

Most of these big systems are mixed-radix tori, which are not the best option for minimizing distances and efficiently using network resources. This paper is focused on improving the topological properties of this kind of networks. By using integral matrices to deal with Cayley graphs over Abelian groups, we have been able to propose and analyze a family of high-dimensional mesh-based interconnection networks. As they are built over n-dimensional grids that induce a regular tiling of space, these topologies have been denoted lattice graphs. Higher dimensional networks can be composed over these graphs by means of a lift operation, which is also introduced in the paper. Easy network partitioning and minimal routing algorithm are also provided for these topologies based on this new network operation. Later we focus on cubic crystal lattices for modeling symmetric 3D networks and to show how lattice graphs can help in the design of twisted interconnection networks.

Increasingly, sophisticated network measurement tasks such as anomaly detection and security forensic analysis are requiring in-depth fine-grained flow-level measurements. However, performing in-depth per-flow measurements (e.g., detailed payload analysis) is often an expensive process. Given the fast-changing Internet traffic landscape and large traffic volume, a single monitor is not capable of accomplishing the measurement tasks for all applications of interest due to its resource constraint. Moreover, uncovering global network behavior requires network-wide traffic measurements at multiple monitors across the network since traffic measured at any single monitor only provides a partial view and may not be sufficient or accurate. These factors call for coordinated measurements among multiple distributed monitors. In this paper, we present a centralized optimization framework, LEISURE (Load-EqualIzed meaSUREment), for load-balancing network measurement workloads across distributed monitors. Specifically, we consider various load-balancing problems under different objectives and study their extensions to support both fixed and flexible monitor deployment scenarios. We formulate the latter flexible monitor deployment case as an MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem and propose several heuristic algorithms to approximate the optimal solution and reduce the computation complexity. We evaluate LEISURE via detailed simulations on Abilene and GEANT network traces to show that LEISURE can achieve much better load-balanced performance (e.g., 4.75× smaller peak workload and 70× smaller variance in workloads) across all coordinated monitors in comparison to a naive solution (uniform assignment) to accomplish network-wide traffic measurement tasks under the fixed monitor deployment scenario. We also show that under the flexible monitor deployment setting, our heuristic solutions can achieve almost the same load-balancing performance as the optimal solution while reducing the computation times by a factor up to 22.5× in Abilene and 800× in GEANT."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.188"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573959"",""Load-balancing";"network-wide traffic measurement"",""Monitoring";Routing;IP networks;Optimization;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;"Urban areas"","""",""14"",""1"",""32"",""USGov"",""2 Aug 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The first problem, called single delay-tolerant assignment (SDA), allows at most one delay-tolerant service to be paired with each real-time service, whereas the second problem, called multiple delay-tolerant assignment (MDA), allows multiple delay-tolerant services to be paired (in different times) with the same real-time service. For the SDA problem, we propose an optimal algorithm. For the MDA problem, which is computationally intractable, we give an approximation algorithm. We evaluate the benefits of the energy-efficient pairing strategy via simulations on synthetic traces. The MDA algorithm can save up to the 60 percent of the energy consumption using 4G network assuming an intensive smartphone usage, while the SDA algorithm saves up to the 20 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2360693"",""Marie Curie Fellowship(grant numbers:PCIG11-GA-2012-321980)"; European Commission for the PRISM-CODE; TENACE PRIN Project(grant numbers:20103P34XC); ARS Techno-Media PRIN Project(grant numbers:2010N5K7EB); MIUR;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912987"",""Energy Saving, Smartphones";Delay-Tolerant Services;Parallel Communications;Measurements;Maximum Weighted Matching;Generalized Assignment Problem;Energy saving;smartphones;delay-tolerant services;parallel communications;measurements;maximum weighted matching;"generalized assignment problem"",""Real-time systems";Smart phones;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Approximation algorithms;Internet;Polynomials;"Energy consumption"","""",""6"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""29 Sep 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

This paper presents LIBRA, a lightweight strategy to address the data skew problem among the reducers of MapReduce applications. Unlike previous work, LIBRA does not require any pre-run sampling of the input data or prevent the overlap between the map and the reduce stages. It uses an innovative sampling method which can achieve a highly accurate approximation to the distribution of the intermediate data by sampling only a small fraction of the intermediate data during the normal map processing. It allows the reduce tasks to start copying as soon as the chosen sample map tasks (only a small fraction of map tasks which are issued first) complete. It supports the split of large keys when application semantics permit and the total order of the output data. It considers the heterogeneity of the computing resources when balancing the load among the reduce tasks appropriately. LIBRA is applicable to a wide range of applications and is transparent to the users. We implement LIBRA in Hadoop and our experiments show that LIBRA has negligible overhead and can speed up the execution of some popular applications by up to a factor of 4."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2350972"",""National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2013AA013203)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61170056);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882249"",""MapReduce";data skew;sampling;"partitioning"",""Indexes";Parallel processing;Sampling methods;Distributed databases;Approximation methods;Semantics;"Delays"","""",""86"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""22 Aug 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Concurrent loops are generally not bound to iterate in lock-step, allowing better alignment of thread flows via iteration scheduling.

In this paper, we study the problem of energy-aware static resource allocation in an environment where a collection of independent (non-communicating) tasks (“bag-of-tasks”) is assigned to a heterogeneous computing system. Computing systems often operate in environments where task execution times vary (e.g., due to cache misses or data dependent execution times). We model these execution times stochastically, using probability density functions. We want our resource allocations to be robust against these variations, where we define energy-robustness as the probability that the energy budget is not violated, and  makespan-robustness as the probability a makespan deadline is not violated.

It works well if the hardware of a cluster is well configured. However, our survey has indicated that common hardware configurations in small- and medium-size enterprises may not be suitable for such tasks. This situation is more challenging for memory-constrained systems, in which the memory is a bottleneck resource compared with the CPU power and thus does not meet the needs of large-scale data processing. The traditional high performance computing (HPC) system is an example of the memory-constrained system according to our survey. In this paper, we have developed Mammoth, a new MapReduce system, which aims to improve MapReduce performance using global memory management. In Mammoth, we design a novel rule-based heuristic to prioritize memory allocation and revocation among execution units (mapper, shuffler, reducer, etc.), to maximize the holistic benefits of the Map/Reduce job when scheduling each memory unit. We have also developed a multi-threaded execution engine, which is based on Hadoop but runs in a single JVM on a node. In the execution engine, we have implemented the algorithm of memory scheduling to realize global memory management, based on which we further developed the techniques such as sequential disk accessing, multi-cache and shuffling from memory, and solved the problem of full garbage collection in the JVM. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare Mammoth against the native Hadoop platform. The results show that the Mammoth system can reduce the job execution time by more than 40 percent in typical cases, without requiring any modifications of the Hadoop programs. When a system is short of memory, Mammoth can improve the performance by up to 5.19 times, as observed for I/O intensive applications, such as PageRank. We also compared Mammoth with Spark. Although Spark can achieve better performance than Mammoth for interactive and iterative applications when the memory is sufficient, our experimental results show that for batch processing applications, Mammoth can adapt better to various memory environments and outperform Spark when the memory is insufficient, and can obtain similar performance as Spark when the memory is sufficient. Given the growing importance of supporting large-scale data processing and analysis and the proven success of the MapReduce platform, the Mammoth system can have a promising potential and impact."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2345068"",""NSFC(grant numbers:61370104,61133008)"; National Science and Technology Pillar Program(grant numbers:2012BAH14F02); MOE-Intel Special Research Fund of Information Technology(grant numbers:MOE-INTEL-2012-01); Chinese Universities Scientific Fund(grant numbers:2014TS008);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6869021"",""MapReduce";data processing;"HPC"",""Memory management";Engines;Data structures;Receivers;Data processing;Runtime;"Educational institutions"","""",""27"","""",""31"",""IEEE"",""31 Jul 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Extending WSN lifetime is complicated because nodes often experience differential power consumption. For example, nodes closer to the sink in a given routing topology transmit more data and thus consume power more rapidly than nodes farther from the sink. Inspired by the huddling behavior of emperor penguins where the penguins take turns on the cold extremities of a penguin “huddle”, we propose mobile node rotation, a new method for using low-cost mobile sensor nodes to address differential power consumption and extend WSN lifetime. Specifically, we propose to rotate the nodes through the high power consumption locations. We propose efficient algorithms for single and multiple rounds of rotations. Our extensive simulations show that mobile node rotation can extend WSN topology lifetime by more than eight times on average which is significantly better than existing alternatives."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2329851"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828738"",""Wireless sensor networks";network lifetime;energy optimization;mobile nodes;"wireless routing"",""Wireless sensor networks";Topology;Network topology;Mobile nodes;"Power demand"","""",""16"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""10 Jun 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of their large size, they often require a combined memory model, in which some of the elements are stored in a fast memory (for example, cache or on-chip SRAM) while others are stored in much slower memory (namely, the main memory or off-chip DRAM). This makes the implementation of real-life hash tables particularly delicate, as a suboptimal choice of the hashing scheme parameters may result in a higher average query time, and therefore in a lower throughput. In this paper, we focus on multiple-choice hash tables. Given the number of choices, we study the tradeoff between the load of a hash table and its average lookup time. The problem is solved by analyzing an equivalent problem: the expected maximum matching size of a random bipartite graph with a fixed left-side vertex degree. Given two choices, we provide exact results for any finite system, and also deduce asymptotic results as the fast memory size increases. In addition, we further consider other variants of this problem and model the impact of several parameters. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our models on Internet backbone traces, and illustrate the impact of the memories speed difference on the choice of parameters. In particular, we show that the common intuition of entirely avoiding slow memory accesses by using highly efficient schemes (namely, with many fast-memory choices) is not always optimal."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2314683"",""European Research Council(grant numbers:210389)"; European Research Council(grant numbers:259085); Alon Fellowship; ATS-WD Career Development Chair; Loewengart Research Fund; Intel ICRI-CI Center; Israel Ministry of Science and Technology; Israeli Centers of Research Excellence; Technion Funds for Security research(grant numbers:4/11);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781627"",""Maximum matching";random bipartite graph;"combined SRAM/DRAM memory model"",""Random access memory";Bipartite graph;Throughput;System-on-chip;Memory management;Internet;"Performance evaluation"","""",""13"","""",""46"",""IEEE"",""1 Apr 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When receiving a referral request, a participant will locally choose among her neighbors some user to relay the request. In our mechanism, several closely coupled methods are carefully designed to improve the performance of distributed search, including, profile matching, social acquaintance prediction, score function for locally choosing relay neighbors, and budget estimation. We conduct extensive experiments on several data sets of online social networks.

As the performance increases, the energy consumption in these systems also increases significantly. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is considered an efficient scheme to achieve the goal of saving energy, because it allows processors to dynamically adjust their supply voltages and/or execution frequencies to work on different power/energy levels. In this paper, we consider scheduling non-preemptive frame-based tasks on DVFS-enabled heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms with the goal of achieving minimal overall energy consumption. We consider three types of heterogeneous platforms, namely, dependent platforms without runtime adjusting, dependent platforms with runtime adjusting, and independent platforms. For these three platforms, we first formulate the problems as binary integer programming problems, and then, relax them as convex optimization problems, which can be solved by the well-known interior point method. We propose a Relaxation-based Iterative Rounding Algorithm (RIRA), which tries to achieve the task set partition, that is closest to the optimal solution of the relaxed problems, in every step of a task-to-processor assignment. Experiments and comparisons show that our RIRA produces a better performance than existing methods and a simple but naive method, and achieves near-optimal scheduling under most cases. We also provide comprehensive complexity, accuracy and scalability analysis for the RIRA approach by investigating the interior-point method and by running specially designed experiments.

Although many studies have exploited the mobility of sensors to improve the quality of coverage and connectivity, little attention has been paid to the minimization of sensors' movement, which often consumes the majority of the limited energy of sensors and thus shortens the network lifetime significantly. To fill in this gap, this paper addresses the challenges of the Mobile Sensor Deployment (MSD) problem and investigates how to deploy mobile sensors with minimum movement to form a WSN that provides both target coverage and network connectivity. To this end, the MSD problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: the Target COVerage (TCOV) problem and the Network CONnectivity (NCON) problem. We then solve TCOV and NCON one by one and combine their solutions to address the MSD problem. The NP-hardness of TCOV is proved. For a special case of TCOV where targets disperse from each other farther than double of the coverage radius, an exact algorithm based on the Hungarian method is proposed to find the optimal solution. For general cases of TCOV, two heuristic algorithms, i.e., the Basic algorithm based on clique partition and the TV-Greedy algorithm based on Voronoi partition of the deployment region, are proposed to reduce the total movement distance of sensors. For NCON, an efficient solution based on the Steiner minimum tree with constrained edge length is proposed. The combination of the solutions to TCOV and NCON, as demonstrated by extensive simulation experiments, offers a promising solution to the original MSD problem that balances the load of different sensors and prolongs the network lifetime consequently."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2333011"",""National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61232001,61103203,61173169,61173051)"; Major Science & Technology Research Program for Strategic Emerging Industry of Hunan(grant numbers:2012GK4054); Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:14C0030);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846302"",""Wireless sensor networks";target coverage;connectivity;mobile sensors;"energy consumption"",""Mobile communication";Mobile computing;Partitioning algorithms;Wireless sensor networks;Heuristic algorithms;Energy consumption;"Educational institutions"","""",""148"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""30 Jun 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, a goodput model of the problem is built to understand why goodput collapse occurs and a solution to the problem based on the theoretical analysis is proposed. We found that the TCP Incast goodput deterioration is mainly caused by two types of timeouts, one happens at the tail of data blocks and dominates the goodput when the number of senders is small, while the other one at the head of data blocks and governs the goodput when the number of senders is large. The proposed model describes the relationship between these two types of timeouts and the Incast communication pattern, block size, bottleneck buffer size, and so on. The simulation results indicate that the model well characterizes the features of the TCP Incast problem. Enlightened by the analysis, a PRiority-based solution to the TCP INcast problem (PRIN) is proposed, which avoids timeouts at the head of blocks by reducing TCP send window and prevents timeouts at the tail of blocks by leveraging priority technology.

To address this issue, we propose a new parallelization scheme for multi-threaded shared-memory machines based on the concept of nearest-neighbor (NN) chains. The proposed multi-threaded algorithm allocates available threads into two groups, one for managing NN chains and the other for updating distance information. In-depth analysis of our approach gives insight into the ideal configuration of threads and theoretical performance bounds. We evaluate our proposed method by testing it with multiple public datasets and comparing its performance with that of several alternatives. In our test, the proposed method completes hierarchical clustering 3.09-51.79 times faster than the alternatives. Our test results also reveal the effects of performance-limiting factors such as starvation in chain growing, overhead incurred from using synchronization locks, and hardware aspects including memory-bandwidth saturation.

Therefore, routing is usually conducted in a store-carry-forward manner to exploit the scarce communication opportunities. As a result, different packet routing strategies, i.e., which packet to be forwarded or stored with priority, can lead to different routing performance objectives, such as minimal average delay and maximal hit rate. On the other hand, incentive systems are necessary for DTNs since nodes may be selfish and may not be cooperative on packet forwarding/storage. However, current incentive systems for DTNs mainly focus on encouraging nodes to participate in packet forwarding/storage but fail to further encourage nodes to follow a certain packet routing strategy to realize a routing performance objective. We name the former as the first aspect of cooperation and the latter as the second aspect of cooperation in DTN routing. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the routing strategy that can realize different performance objectives when nodes are fully cooperative, i.e., are willing to follow both aspects of cooperation. We then propose Multicent, a game theoretical incentive scheme that can encourage nodes to follow the two aspects of cooperation even when they are selfish. Basically, Multicent assigns credits for packet forwarding/storage in proportional to the priorities specified in the routing strategy. Multicent also supports adjustable Quality of Service (QoS) for packet routing between specific sources and destinations.

In this paper, motivated by the increasing prevalence of multipacket reception (MPR) technologies such as CDMA and MIMO, we study neighbor discovery in MPR networks that allow packets from multiple simultaneous transmitters to be received successfully at a receiver. Starting with a clique of n nodes, we first analyze a simple Aloha-like algorithm and show that it takes Θ((n ln n)/k) time to discover all neighbors with high probability when allowing up to k simultaneous transmissions. We then design two adaptive neighbor discovery algorithms that dynamically adjust the transmission probability for each node. We show that the adaptive algorithms yield a Θ(ln n) improvement over the Aloha-like scheme for a clique with n nodes and are thus order-optimal. Finally, we analyze our algorithms in a general multi-hop network setting. We show an upper bound of O((Δ ln n)/k) for the Aloha-like algorithm when the maximum node degree is Δ, which is at most a factor ln n worse than the optimal. In addition, when Δ is large, we show that the adaptive algorithms are orderoptimal, i.e., have a running time of O(Δ/k) which matches the lower bound for the problem."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2321157"",""National Science Foundation(grant numbers:0835735)"; CAREER Award(grant numbers:0746841); ARO(grant numbers:W911NF-08-1-0233);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846356"",""Wireless networks";ad hoc networks;multipacket reception;network management;neighbor discovery;"randomized algorithms"",""Algorithm design and analysis";Antenna arrays;Multiaccess communication;Wireless networks;MIMO;Receivers;"Network topology"","""",""20"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""30 Jun 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To reduce the cost of storage, transmission and processing of time series data generated by sensor nodes, the need for more compact representations of time series data is compelling. Although a large number of data compression algorithms have been proposed to reduce data volume, their offline characteristic or super-linear time complexity prevents them from being applied directly on time series data generated by sensor nodes.

The current solutions for this challenge usually depend on passengers to actively provide their locations in advance for pickups. To address this challenge without the burden on passengers, in this paper, we propose a cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to find efficient routes to pick up passengers to reduce cruising miles. According to the real-time pick-up events from nearby taxicabs, pCruise characterizes a cruising process with a cruising graph, and assigns weights on edges of the cruising graph to indicate the utility of cruising corresponding road segments. Our weighting process considers the number of nearby passengers and taxicabs together in real-time, aiming at two scenarios where taxicabs are explicitly or implicitly coordinated with each other. Based on a weighted cruising graph, when a taxicab becomes vacant, pCruise provides a distributed online scheduling strategy to obtain and update an efficient cruising route with the minimum length and at least one arriving passenger. We evaluate pCruise based on a real-world GPS dataset from a Chinese city Shenzhen with 14";"000 taxicabs.

Traditional MAC protocols with CSMA often assume that a transmission must be deferred if the channel is busy, so they focus more on the optimization of serial transmission performance. Recent advances in physical layer, however, allows a receiver to reengage onto a stronger incoming signal from an ongoing transmission or interference, and thus shows the potential of parallel transmissions. Indeed, even if the channel is busy, a node has opportunities to carry out a successful transmission. In this study, we propose opportunistic concurrency (OPC), a new MAC layer scheme, which enables sensor nodes to capture the opportunistic concurrency and carry out parallel transmissions instead of always waiting for a clear channel. Based on local concurrency map, which encodes the interactions among different links, OPC utilizes concurrency control algorithm to make transmission decision distributedly. Our experiments on a testbed consisting of 60 TelosB sensor motes identify the transmission opportunities in WSNs with OPC.

Existing strategies in the literature, however, require either exact knowledge or the distribution of demands in the long-term future, which significantly limits their use in practice.

SPMs in multi-core systems can be accessed by both local core and remote cores. In order to alleviate data contention on a SPM unit, multi-port SPMs are employed in multi-core systems. In such systems, proper task scheduling and data assignment can significantly improve the overall performance by exploring the parallelism of computation tasks and concurrent data accesses on SPMs. Since scheduling for multi-core systems is NP-Complete in general. In this paper, we propose an ILP formulation to optimally determine the task scheduling and data assignment on multi-core systems with multi-port SPMs. Since ILP takes exponential time to finish, we also propose a heuristic method, including the task assignment with remote access reduced (TARAR) algorithm and the minimum memory access cost (MMAC) algorithm, to obtain near optimal solutions within polynomial time.

Conventional data and query indexing approaches generally do not apply for excessive costs in either maintenance or space. Aiming at these problems, this study first proposes a new indexing structure by fusing an adaptive cell and KDB-tree, namely CKDB-tree. A cell-tree indexing approach has been developed on the basis of the CKDB-tree that supports dynamic continuous queries. The approach significantly reduces the space costs and scales well with the increasing data size. Towards providing a scalable solution to filtering massive steaming data, this study has explored the feasibility to utilize the contemporary general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU). The CKDB-tree-based approach has been extended to operate on both the CPU (host) and the GPU (device).

Two major research challenges remain along this direction: (1) how to portray the effect of individuals' adaptive behaviors under various situations in the evacuation procedures and (2) how to simulate complex evacuation scenarios involving huge crowds at the individual level due to the ultrahigh complexity of these scenarios. In this study, a simulation framework for general evacuation scenarios has been developed. Each individual in the scenario is modeled as an adaptable and autonomous agent driven by a weight-based decision-making mechanism. The simulation is intended to characterize the individuals' adaptable behaviors, the interactions among individuals, among small groups of individuals, and between the individuals and the environment. To handle the second challenge, this study adopts GPGPU to sustain massively parallel modeling and simulation of an evacuation scenario. An efficient scheme has been proposed to minimize the overhead to access the global system state of the simulation process maintained by the GPU platform.

The main reason is due to the high code complexity and its large size when considering commercially valuable code. Such code is often rich with pointers, heavily nested conditional statements, nested while-based loops, function calls, etc. These constructs prevent existing compiler analysis from extracting the full parallelization potential. We propose a new paradigm to overcome this issue by automatically transforming the code' into a much simpler skeleton-like form that is more conductive for auto-parallelization. We then apply existing tools of source-level automatic parallelization on the skeletonized code in order to expose possible parallelization patterns. The skeleton code, along with the parallelized version, are then provided to the programmer in the form of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) recommendation. The proposed skeletonization algorithm replaces pointers by integer indexes and C-struct references by references to multi-dimensional arrays. For example, the loop while(p ≠ NULL) {p → val + +"; p = p → next;} will be skeletonized to: for(Ip = 0; Ip <; N; Ip + +){Aval[Ip] + +;"} where Aval[] holds the embedding of the original list. Consequently, the main goal of the skeletonization process is to embed pointer-based data structures into arrays. Though the skeletonized code is not semantically equivalent to the original code, it suggests a possible parallelization pattern for the selected code segment and can be used as an effective parallelization hint to the programmer. We applied the method on the SPEC CPU benchmarks and the skeletonization process detected 27 percent additional loops that can be parallelized/vectorized on top of the compiler auto-parallelizer/vectorizer. A performance gain of up to 45 percent was measured for benchmarks that were manually parallelized based on the generated skeleton code."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2371463"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987337"",""Program skeletons, parallelization, parallel programming"",""Arrays";Indexes;Skeleton;Shape;Optimization;"Parallel processing"","""",""1"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""18 Dec 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of ADS-B with existing radar systems and performance optimization of ADS-B systems to improve the safety and efficiency of conflict detection and resolution in NextGen. We have developed a simulation environment which models the complex interplay among the air traffic load, the radar systems, the ADS-B systems, and the wireless channel.

This model is then used to design an adaptive ADS-B protocol for maximizing the information coverage while guaranteeing reliable and timely communication in air traffic surveillance networks. Simulation results show that the effect of ADS-B interference on the current radar system is negligible. The operational ability of ADS-B meets the performance requirements of conflict detection and resolution in air traffic control.

Currently, the combined-block-storage approach is prevalent. However, the approach employs the traditional file systems such as ExtFS and may cause inefficiency when accessing small files randomly located in the disk. This paper focuses on optimizing the performance of data servers in accessing massive numbers of small files. We present a Flat Lightweight File System (iFlatLFS) to manage small files, which is based on a simple metadata scheme and a flat storage architecture. iFlatLFS is designed to substitute the traditional file system on data servers and can be deployed underneath distributed file systems that store massive numbers of small files. iFlatLFS can greatly simplify the original data access procedure. The new metadata proposed in this paper occupies only a fraction of the metadata size based on traditional file systems. We have implemented iFlatLFS in CentOS 5.5 and integrated it into an open source Distributed File System (DFS), called Taobao FileSystem (TFS), which is developed by a top B2C service provider, Alibaba, in China and is managing over 28.6 billion small photos. We have conducted extensive experiments to verify the performance of iFlatLFS. The results show that when the file size ranges from 1 to 64 KB, iFlatLFS is faster than Ext4 by 48 and 54 percent on average for random read and write in the DFS environment, respectively. Moreover, after iFlatLFS is integrated into TFS, iFlatLFS-based TFS is faster than the existing Ext4-based TFS by 45 and 49 percent on average for random read access and hybrid access (the mix of read and write accesses), respectively."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2377720"",""China HGJ Project(grant numbers:2013ZX01040-002)"; Leverhulme Trust(grant numbers:RPG-101); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61133005,61432005);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977977"",""Distributed File System";Data Server;Small File;Performance Optimization;Distributed file system;data server;small file;"performance optimization"",""Servers";File systems;Distributed databases;Performance evaluation;Optimization;"Data models"","""",""24"","""",""45"",""EU"",""5 Dec 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

How to reduce such performance degradation becomes a critical issue to address. In this paper, we propose a profiling-based server consolidation framework which minimizes the number of physical machines (PMs) used in data centers while maintaining satisfactory performance of various workloads. Inside this framework, we first profile the performance losses of various workloads under two situations: running in co-location and experiencing migrations. We then design two modules: (1) consolidation planning module which, given a set of workloads, minimizes the number of PMs by an integer programming model, and (2) migration planning module which, given a source VM placement scenario and a target VM placement scenario, minimizes the number of VM migrations by a polynomial time algorithm. Also, based on the workload performance profiles, both modules can guarantee the performance losses of various workloads below configurable thresholds.

More and more applications are being designed for exploring those idle resources. In this paper, we focus on the idle computational resources, including both human intelligence and machine computing abilities, in mobile social networks (MSNs). Based on the unique features of MSN, we design a new cooperative system, called social-crowdsourcing. The distributed and infrastructure-free features of the system make it more attractive than traditional crowdsourcing platforms. In the proposed system, a huge work is gradually partitioned into smaller pieces, and is propagated from node to node. However, how to partition and allocate these segments is a critical problem, which directly affects the work's completion time and system throughput. Due to the lack of global information, independent relay nodes are likely to make conflicted decisions, which will cause an unbalanced workload distribution on participating nodes. In this paper, we find that, for a work at different processing stages, one should adopt distinct workload exchanging schemes, moving from a progressive method to a conservative one. Based on this observation, we propose an adaptive workload allocation scheme, in which a participating node can gradually switch his decision strategy according to the workload statuses of neighboring nodes. By using our approach, system throughput can be significantly improved, and large works can finish within a nearly optimal time. Unlike in traditional scheduling problems, we take a human's rejection, contact delay, and social similarity into consideration.

Then, based on it, by devising a new technique of attribute-based designated verifier signature, a patient self-controllable multi-level privacy-preserving cooperative authentication scheme (PSMPA) realizing three levels of security and privacy requirement in distributed m-healthcare cloud computing system is proposed. The directly authorized physicians, the indirectly authorized physicians and the unauthorized persons in medical consultation can respectively decipher the personal health information and/or verify patients’ identities by satisfying the access tree with their own attribute sets.

Consequently, these schemes cannot accommodate the desired performance levels, especially when dealing with high-bandwidth applications that require efficient gateway-based management. To fill in this gap, a new strategy for supporting QoS-aware multicast in large-scale WCNs is proposed in this paper.

To control the system temperature under a certain thermal limit, many Dynamic Thermal Managements (DTMs) have been proposed. Recently, for emergent cooling, the full throttling scheme is usually employed as the system temperature reaches the alarming level.

The RCTP model can precisely predict the temperature with heterogeneous workload assignment with low constant computational complexity. Based on the predictive temperature, the proposed T-PDTM scheme will assign the suitable clock frequency for each node of the NoC system to perform early temperature control through power budget distribution. Based on the experimental results, compared with the conventional reactive throttled-based DTMs, the T-PDTM scheme can help to reduce 11.4∼80.3 percent fully throttled nodes and improves the network throughput by around 1.5∼211.8 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308206"",""National Science Council(grant numbers:NSC 102-2220-E-002-001,100-2221-E-002-091-MY3)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748042"",""Proactive";dynamic thermal management;3D MPSoC;3D IC;NoC;DVFS;"power budget"",""Temperature sensors";Three-dimensional displays;Temperature control;Thermal management;Predictive models;Temperature measurement;"Thermal conductivity"","""",""33"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""25 Feb 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To regain load balance among all disks including old and new, RAID-4 scaling requires moving certain data blocks onto newly added disks. Existing data redistribution approaches to RAID-4 scaling, restricted by preserving a round-robin data distribution, require migrating all the data, which results in an expensive cost for RAID-4 scaling. In this paper, we propose McPod-a new data redistribution approach to accelerating RAID-4 scaling. McPod minimizes the number of data blocks to be moved while maintaining a uniform data distribution across all data disks. McPod also optimizes data migration with four techniques. First, it coalesces multiple accesses to physically successive blocks into a single I/O. Second, it piggybacks parity updates during data migration to reduce the cost of maintaining consistent parities. Third, it outsources all parity updates brought by RAID scaling to a surrogate disk. Fourth, it delays recording data migration on disks to minimize the number of metadata writes without compromising data reliability. We implement McPod in Linux Kernel 2.6.32.9, and evaluate its performance by replaying three real-system traces. The results demonstrate that McPod outperforms the existing “moving-everything” approach by 67.78-79.64 percent in redistribution time and by 14.24-27.16 percent in user response time. The experiments also illustrate that the performance of the RAID scaled using McPod is almost identical to that of the round-robin RAID."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308219"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748089"",""Access coalescing";data migration;I/O parallelism;metadata update;parity update;"RAID-4 scaling"",""Nickel";Distributed databases;Layout;Acceleration;Reliability;Outsourcing;"Parallel processing"","""",""9"","""",""31"",""IEEE"",""25 Feb 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The scheduling of the VMs and their VCPUs generates the delay, the dirtiness of the candidate pages for balancing makes the delay fluctuated, and a conflict of two reclamation policies between the guest OS and the hypervisor deteriorates the application performance. As a remedy to these problems, we propose HyperDealer2 (HD2), which selects the victim pages based on the reference patterns of clean pages, reclaims them with hypervisor-level paging, and reallocates those pages with explicit ballooning of the recipient guest OS. HD2 eliminates the involvement of victim VMs in memory reclamation and extends the dwell time of reclaimed pages in the reclaimed state. Consequently, HD2 significantly reduces the time taken to reallocate memory with a low overhead and enhances the value of additional memory for the recipient VMs. The experimental results of HD2 show that the execution time of memory-intensive applications in the recipient VM is reduced by up to 50 percent in spite of less than 2 percent performance penalty."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2340854"",""Ministry of Knowledge Economy(grant numbers:10035231-2010-01)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860294"",""Memory balancing";virtualization;consolidated;VM;"reference pattern"",""Virtual machine monitors";Memory management;Delays;Resource management;Monitoring;Hardware;"Degradation"","""",""1"","""",""41"",""IEEE"",""18 Jul 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So, new, opportunistic, adaptive fully localized mechanisms are needed for improving user anonymity. This paper proposes reputation aware localized adaptive obfuscation for mobile opportunistic networks that comprises of two complementary techniques: opportunistic collaborative testing of nodes' obfuscation behaviour (OCOT) and multidimensional adaptive anonymisation (AA). OCOT-AA is driven by both explicit and implicit reputation building, complex graph connectivity analytics and obfuscation history analyses. We show that OCOT-AA is very efficient in terms of achieving high levels of node identity obfuscation and managing low delays for answering queries between sources and destinations while enabling fast detection and avoidance of malicious nodes typically within the fraction of time within the experiment duration. We perform extensive experiments to compare OCOT-AA with several other competitive and benchmark protocols and show that it outperforms them across a range of metrics over a one month real-life GPS trace.

However, the lack of high-level abstractions in previous heterogeneous parallel programming models force programmers to resort to multiple code versions, complex data copy steps and synchronization schemes when exchanging data between multiple GPU devices, which results in high software development cost, poor maintainability, and even poor performance. This paper describes the HPE runtime system, and the associated architecture support, which enables a simple, efficient programming interface for exchanging data between multiple GPUs through either interconnects or cross-node network interfaces. The runtime and architecture support presented in this paper can also be used to support other types of accelerators. We show that the simplified programming interface reduces programming complexity. The research presented in this paper started in 2009. It has been implemented and tested extensively in several generations of HPE runtime systems as well as adopted into the NVIDIA GPU hardware and drivers for CUDA 4.0 and beyond since 2011. The availability of real hardware that support key HPE features gives rise to a rare opportunity for studying the effectiveness of the hardware support by running important benchmarks on real runtime and hardware. Experimental results show that in a exemplar heterogeneous system, peer DMA and double-buffering, pinned buffers, and software techniques can improve the inter-accelerator data communication bandwidth by 2×. They can also improve the execution speed by 1.6× for a 3D finite difference, 2.5× for 1D FFT, and 1.6× for merge sort, all measured on real hardware. The proposed architecture support enables the HPE runtime to transparently deploy these optimizations under simple portable user code, allowing system designers to freely employ devices of different capabilities.

In this study, we propose an efficient scaling scheme for Reed-Solomon-coded storage clusters called Scale-RS, which has three salient features. First, Scale-RS achieves uniform data distribution by equally placing data blocks among old and new chunks using a transposed data layout. Second, Scale-RS minimizes data movement incurred in the procedures of data redistribution and parity update. Scale-RS not only reaches the lower bound of data migration traffic by transferring necessary data blocks from old data chunks to new chunks, but it also reduces update traffic via generating parity difference blocks from data blocks stored in an individual data chunk. Third, Scale-RS improves the I/O performance of scaled storage clusters in terms of read parallelism and write throughput. We implement Scale-RS along with two alternative scaling schemes in a Reed-Solomon-coded storage cluster, on which real-world I/O traces are replayed. Experimental results demonstrate that Scale-RS achieves the highest read performance among the three scaling schemes after data redistribution. When it comes to scaling from six data chunks to nine, Scale-RS can outperform the other two scaling schemes in terms of aggregate write throughput by a factor of 2.85 and 3.05 under online filling and offline filling, respectively.

The trust values are attached to the nodes’ public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings.

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising technique to ensure the end-to-end security of big data in the cloud. However, the policy updating has always been a challenging issue when ABE is used to construct access control schemes. A trivial implementation is to let data owners retrieve the data and re-encrypt it under the new access policy, and then send it back to the cloud. This method, however, incurs a high communication overhead and heavy computation burden on data owners. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enabling efficient access control with dynamic policy updating for big data in the cloud. We focus on developing an outsourced policy updating method for ABE systems.

Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a new technique for handling data in a segment-based manner. Considering a collection of neighbouring data segments as random variables, we determine those behaving abnormally by exploiting their spatial predictabilities and, motivated by spatial analysis, specifically investigate how to implement a prediction variance detector in a WSN. As the communication cost incurred in aggregating a covariance matrix is finally optimised using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and differential compression, the proposed scheme is able to efficiently detect a wide range of long-term anomalies. In theory, comparing to the regular centralised approach, it can reduce the communication cost by approximately 80 percent.

This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively.

Works reported in literature use support metric-based sensor association rules which employ the occurrence frequency of patterns as criteria. However, consideration of the binary frequency of a pattern is not a sufficient indicator for finding meaningful patterns because it only reflects the number of epochs which contain that pattern in the dataset. The share measure of sensorsets could discover useful knowledge about trigger values associated with a sensor. Here, we propose a new type of behavioral pattern called share-frequent sensor patterns (SFSPs) by considering the non-binary frequency values of sensors in epochs. SFSPs can find a correlation among a set of sensors and hence can improve the performance of WSNs in a resource management process. In this paper, a share-frequent sensor pattern tree (ShrFSP-tree) has been proposed to facilitate a pattern growth mining technique to discover SFSPs from WSN data.

The existing security solutions mainly focus on the authentication to realize that a user’s privative data cannot be illegally accessed, but neglect a subtle privacy issue during a user challenging the cloud server to request other users for data sharing. The challenged access request itself may reveal the user’s privacy no matter whether or not it can obtain the data access permissions.

In this paper, we propose a new strategy for collision resolution. First, we shelve the collisions and identify the tags that do not involve reader collisions.

To avoid large overhead in evidence collection process, self-diagnosis injects fault inference modules into sensor nodes and let them make local decisions. Diagnosis results from single nodes, however, are generally inaccurate due to the narrow scope of system performances. Besides, existing self-diagnosis methods usually lead to inconsistent results from different inference processes. How to balance the workload among the sensor nodes in a diagnosis task is a critical issue. In this work, we present a new in-network diagnosis approach named Local-Diagnosis (LD2), which conducts the diagnosis process in a local area. LD2 achieves diagnosis decision through distributed evidence fusion operations. Each sensor node provides its own judgements and the evidences are fused within a local area based on the Dempster-Shafer theory, resulting in the consensus diagnosis report.

The system modeling module uses machine learning techniques to learn a model for predicting the SLA penalty cost for each tenant under different resource allocations. Based on the learned model, the resource allocating module dynamically adjusts the resource allocation by weighing the potential reduction of SLA penalty cost against increase of infrastructure cost and action cost.

Second, the recent trend of geo-replicating content across multiple points of presence spread around the world, done for improving quality of experience (QoE) for users. In this paper, we analyze and explore the tradeoff involving the “freshness” of the information available to the users and WAN bandwidth costs, and we propose ways to reduce the latter through smart update propagation scheduling, by leveraging on the knowledge of the mapping between social relationships and geographic location, the timing regularities and time differences in end user activity. We first assess the potential of our approach by implementing a simple social-aware scheduling algorithm that operates under bandwidth budget constraints and by quantifying its benefits through a trace-driven analysis. We show that it can reduce WAN traffic by up to 55 percent compared to an immediate update of all replicas, with a minimal effect on information freshness and latency. Second, we build TailGate, a practical system that implements our social-aware scheduling approach, which distributes on the fly long-tail content across PoPs at reduced bandwidth costs by flattening the traffic. We evaluate TailGate by using traces from an OSN and show that it can decrease WAN bandwidth costs by as much as 80 percent and improve QoE. We deploy TailGate on PlanetLab and show that even in the case when imprecise social information is available, it can still decrease by a factor of 2 the latency for accessing long-tail YouTube videos."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2312197"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6774946"",""Social networks";content distribution;long-tail;"geo-replication"",""Bandwidth";Wide area networks;Resource management;Videos;Market research;Scheduling algorithms;"Social network services"","""",""7"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""18 Mar 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper we present SANE, the first routing mechanism that combines the advantages of both social-aware and stateless approaches. SANE is based on the observation - that we validate on a real-world trace - that individuals with similar interests tend to meet more often. In SANE, individuals (network members) are characterized by their interest profile, a compact representation of their interests. By implementing a simple routing rule based on interest profile similarity, SANE is free of network state information, thus overcoming the storage capacity problem with existing social-aware approaches. Through thorough experiments, we show the superiority of SANE over existing approaches, both stateful, social-aware and stateless, social-oblivious.

Retrieving desired files efficiently and trustworthily is critical in such a large and jumbled system. However, the issues of efficient searching and trustworthy searching have only been studied separately. Simply combining the methods to achieve the two goals doubles system overhead. In this paper, we first study trace data from Facebook and BitTorrent. Guided by the observations, we propose a system that integrates a social network into a P2P network, named Social-P2P, for simultaneous efficient and trustworthy file sharing. It incorporates three mechanisms: (1) interest/trust-based structure, (2) interest/trust-based file searching, and (3) trust relationship adjustment. By exploiting the social interests and relationships in the social network, the interest/trust-based structure groups common-multi-interest nodes into a cluster and further connects socially close nodes within a cluster. The comparably stable nodes in each cluster form a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for inter-cluster file searching. In the interest/trust-based file searching mechanism, a file query is forwarded to the cluster of the file by the DHT routing first. Then, it is forwarded along constructed connections within a cluster, which achieves high hit rate and reliable routing. Moreover, sharing files among socially close friends discourages nodes from providing faulty files because people are unlikely to risk their reputation in the real-world. In the trust relationship adjustment mechanism, each node in a routing path adaptively decreases its trust on the node that has forwarded a faulty file in order to avoid routing queries towards misbehaving nodes later on. We conducted extensive trace-driven simulations and implemented a prototype on PlanetLab. Experimental results show that Social-P2P achieves highly efficient and trustworthy file sharing compared to current file sharing systems and trust management systems."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2359020"",""U.S. NSF(grant numbers:NSF-1404981,IIS-1354123,CNS-1254006,CNS-1249603,CNS-0917056)"; Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship(grant numbers:8300751);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902795"",""P2P networks";online social networks;file sharing;P2P networks;online social networks;"file sharing"",""Peer-to-peer computing";Routing;Vectors;Servers;Facebook;"Maintenance engineering"","""",""22"","""",""40"",""IEEE"",""18 Sep 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, data dissemination through proximity-based opportunistic communications attracts the attention of service providers who are eager for solutions of traffic offloading. In this paper, we propose PrefCast, a preference-aware opportunistic content dissemination protocol that uses as few cellular bandwidth as possible to maximally satisfy user preferences for content objects. The efficiency of PrefCast depends on 1) how does the base-station select initial sources, and 2) how does each user forward objects within a limited contact duration. Since mobile users typically form communities and have heterogeneous preferences, PrefCast's base-station selects sources that efficiently produce the maximal utility to their communities. We then derive a model to predict how much utility a forwarder can contribute to future contacts. PrefCast's users can hence use such prediction to find their optimal forwarding schedule, which maximizes the utility contribution, in a distributed way. Our trace-based evaluation shows that, without explicit source selection, PrefCast produces a 15.7 and 22.6 percent higher average utility than the protocols that only consider contact frequency or preference of local contacts, respectively. Enabling source selection in PrefCast further improves the utility by 49.3 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2363652"",""National Science Council"; National Taiwan University; Intel Corporation(grant numbers:NSC102-2911-I-002-001,NSC102-2221-E-001-012-MY2,NTU103R7501);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928487"",""Opportunistic Dissemination";Source Selection;Traffic Offloading;User Preference;Opportunistic dissemination;source selection;traffic offloading;"user preference"",""Communities";Mobile communication;Frequency measurement;Protocols;Schedules;Social network services;"Routing"","""",""28"","""",""48"",""IEEE"",""17 Oct 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To resolve this tension between performance and programmability, this paper describes PeriSCOPE, which automatically optimizes a data-parallel program's procedural code in the context of data flow that is reconstructed from the program's pipeline topology. Such optimizations eliminate unnecessary code and data, perform early data filtering, and calculate small derived values (e.g., predicates) earlier in the pipeline, so that less data - sometimes much less data - is transferred between pipeline stages.

Current summarization and event matching mechanisms based on subscription subsumption  induce heavy event processing load on brokers degrading the performance of CPSNs especially under high rates of churn, i.e., addition, deletion, or modification of subscriptions. Yet, many modern CPS applications such as location-based services or algorithmic trading inherently rely on high frequency subscription changes. This paper describes Beretta, a dynamic CPSN which sustains high throughput and low event-propagation latencies even under a high frequency of subscription changes. Beretta leverages strong event typing and represents all subscriptions in a normalized form as combinations of value intervals and  set inclusions without compromising on expressiveness. Beretta’s “split and subsume” broker algorithm reduces the complexity of matching an event from $O(K\,N)$  to  $O(K\,\log \,N + |result|)$ , with $N$  being the number of subscriptions for the event type and $K$  the number of its attributes. Event types and normalization are exploited to split subscriptions into predicates on  individual event types and attributes and to efficiently regroup these in segment trees and hash maps which yield excellent subsumption properties and support attribute-wise split filtering during event matching. Normalization enables the systematic introduction of parameters into subscriptions to support both parametric and structural updates. This paper also empirically demonstrates the performance improvements due to our techniques through realistic algorithmic trading and highway traffic monitoring benchmarks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2355823"",""US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:0644013,0834529)"; DARPA(grant numbers:N11AP20014);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894211"",""Subscription";summarization;subsumption;normalization;content-based;messaging;Subscription;summarization;subsumption;normalization;content-based;"messaging"",""Subscriptions";Routing;Complexity theory;Grammar;Heuristic algorithms;Context;"Topology"","""",""4"","""",""45"",""IEEE"",""8 Sep 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unfortunately, the absence of physical isolation inevitably opens doors to a number of security threats. In this paper, we demonstrate in EC2 a new type of security vulnerability caused by competition between virtual I/O workloads-i.e., by leveraging the competition for shared resources, an adversary could intentionally slow down the execution of a targeted application in a VM that shares the same hardware. In particular, we focus on I/O resources such as hard-drive throughput and/or network bandwidth-which are critical for data-intensive applications.

Recent research already confirmed the feasibility of running tightly-coupled parallel applications with virtual clusters. However, such types of applications suffer from significant performance degradation, especially as the over-commitment is common in cloud. That is, the number of executable Virtual CPUs (VCPUs) is often larger than that of available Physical CPUs (PCPUs) in the system. The performance degradation is mainly due to the fact that the current virtual machine monitors (VMMs) are unaware of the synchronization requirements of the VMs which are running parallel applications. In this paper, There are two key contributions. (1) We propose an autonomous synchronization-aware VM scheduling (SVS) algorithm, which can effectively mitigate the performance degradation of tightly-coupled parallel applications running atop them in over-committed situation. (2) We integrate the SVS algorithm into Xen VMM scheduler, and rigorously implement a prototype. We evaluate our design on a real cluster environment with NPB benchmark and real-world trace.

We consider two key aspects that have not been explored in this approach. First, through empirical studies, we find that the energy efficiency of cooling systems depends critically on the ambient temperature, which exhibits significant geographical diversity. Temperature diversity can be used to reduce the cooling energy overhead. Second, energy consumption comes from not only interactive workloads driven by user requests, but also delay tolerant batch workloads that run at the back-end. The elastic nature of batch workloads can be exploited to further reduce the energy cost. In this paper, we propose to make workload management temperature aware. We formulate the problem as a joint optimization of request routing for interactive workloads and capacity allocation for batch workloads. We develop a distributed algorithm based on an m-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that extends the classical two-block algorithm. We prove the convergence and rate of convergence results under general assumptions.

Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) can support the approximate queries that unfortunately suffer from imbalanced load and space inefficiency among distributed data servers, which severely limits the query accuracy and incurs long query latency between users and cloud servers. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called NEST, which offers easy-to-use and cost-effective approximate queries for cloud computing. The novelty of NEST is to leverage cuckoo-driven locality-sensitive hashing to find similar items that are further placed closely through cuckoo-driven method to obtain load-balancing buckets in hash tables. NEST hence carries out flat and manageable addressing in adjacent buckets, and obtains constant-scale query complexity even in the worst case. The benefits of NEST include the increments of space utilization and fast query response. Moreover, due to the salient property of flat addressing in NEST, we implement NEST design in a real hybrid storage system, which consists of DRAM, SSD, and hard disk. The flat addressing allows efficient operations in SSD to improve system performance. We argue that a proper “division of labor” among DRAM, SSD, and hard disk in the hybrid and heterogeneous storage hierarchy is desperately needed to strike an optimal balance to remove the indexing bottleneck. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments (on LANL and Microsoft metadata) in a large-scale cloud testbed demonstrate the salient properties of NEST to meet the needs of approximate query service in cloud computing environments.

However, spinning down several disks not only decreases disk parallelism, but also creates new problems, for example, partial chunks of the stripe cannot be accessed directly or multiple chunks of the same stripe are stored on the same disk, which affect spatial locality. We refer these problems as stripe degradation, which results in further performance degradation. To avoid such problems, this paper proposes a new RAID storage architecture called ThinRAID, which uses a subset of disks to build a capacity-adaptive RAID array based on the volume of the data set. Also, the other non-essential disks are spun down to save energy. When the workload is projected to become heavier based on our forecast model, data are migrated to disks that have recently transitioned from standby to active. Furthermore, we also propose a novel data reorganization algorithm that can minimize data migration. We have implemented ThinRAID in the Linux kernel and evaluated its performance and energy efficiency by replaying seven representative traces. Experimental results show that ThinRAID can save 15-27 percent on energy on average over conventional RAID, with minimum performance degradation.

Large-scale real-world experiments were conducted and validated our theoretic findings. We discovered 2365 Tor bridges through the two enumeration approaches and 2369 bridges by only one Tor middle router in 14 days. Our study shows that the bridge discovery based on malicious middle routers is simple, efficient, and effective to discover bridges with little overhead. We also discussed issues related to bridge discovery and mechanisms to counter the malicious bridge discovery."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.249"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616552"",""Anonymous communication";Tor;bridge discovery;attack;"privacy"",""Bridge circuits";Bandwidth;Electronic mail;Bridges;Servers;IP networks;"Internet"","""",""8"","""",""62"",""IEEE"",""1 Oct 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology for moving from isolated service islands to a global social service network (GSSN) by developing a network model that supports service sociability. First, we propose the construction of a GSSN based on the quality of social links. We then propose an algorithm that maps the GSSN into a service cluster network to reduce the search space, and a quality-driven composition approach that enables exploitation of the service cluster network by providing workflow as a service. Finally, experimental results show that our GSSN-based approach can solve the service composition problem well, improving not only the response time but also the success rate."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2320748"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807777"",""Quality of social link";global social service network;workflow as a service;QoS optimization;"service composition"",""Quality of service";Scalability;Social network services;Optimization;Clustering algorithms;Web services;"Cognition"","""",""22"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""29 Apr 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An interesting approach is to use advance bandwidth reservation. Such systems usually assume all requests demand either bandwidth-guarantee (BG) or time-guarantee (TG), but not both. Hence the solutions are tailored for one type of requests. A BG request demands guarantee on bandwidth";" whereas a TG request demands guarantee on time for transfer of data of specified volume. We define a new model that allows users to not only submit both kinds of requests, but also specify flexible demands. We tie up the problem of bandwidth allocation with differential pricing, that gives discounts to users based on the flexibility in their requests. We propose a two-phase, adaptive and flexible bandwidth allocator (A-FBA) that, in one phase admits and allocates minimal bandwidth to dynamically arriving user requests, and in another phase, allocates additional bandwidth for accepted requests maximizing revenue. The problem formulated in first phase is ${\cal NP}$ -hard, while the second phase can be solved in polynomial time. We show that, in comparison to a traditional deterministic model, the A-FBA not only increases the number of accepted requests significantly, but also does so by generating higher revenues."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2325044"",""Singapore A*STAR-SERC(grant numbers:112-172-0015)"; NUS WBS(grant numbers:R-263-000-665-305);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6817564"",""Cloud";bandwidth;QoS;reservation;"pricing"",""Bandwidth";Pricing;Channel allocation;Resource management;Data transfer;Optimization;"Adaptation models"","""",""20"","""",""18"",""IEEE"",""16 May 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We then design truthful greedy and optimal mechanisms for the problem such that the cloud provider provisions VMs based on the requests of the winning users and determines their payments.

A novel resource provisioning framework for organizing the heterogeneous sensing, computing, and communication capabilities of static and mobile devices in the vicinity in order to form an elastic resource pool—a hybrid static/mobile computing grid (also called a loosely-coupled mobile device cloud)—is presented. This local computing grid can be harnessed to enable innovative data- and compute-intensive mobile applications such as ubiquitous context-aware health and wellness monitoring of the elderly, distributed rainfall and flood-risk estimation, distributed object recognition and tracking, and content-based distributed multimedia search and sharing. In order to address challenges such as the inherent uncertainty in the hybrid grid (in terms of network connectivity and device availability), the proposed role-based resource provisioning framework is imparted with autonomic capabilities, namely, self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing.

Most of the works on network coding-based opportunistic routing in the literature assume that the links are independent. This assumption has been invalidated by the recent empirical studies that showed that the correlation among the links can be arbitrary. In this work, we show that the performance of network coding-based opportunistic routing is greatly impacted by the correlation among the links. We formulate the problem of maximizing the throughput while achieving fairness under arbitrary channel conditions, and we identify the structure of its optimal solution. As is typical in the literature, the optimal solution requires a large amount of immediate feedback messages, which is unrealistic. We propose the idea of performing network coding on the feedback messages and show that if the intermediate node waits until receiving only one feedback message from each next-hop node, the optimal level of network coding redundancy can be computed in a distributed manner. The coded feedback messages require a small amount of overhead, as they can be integrated with the packets. Our approach is also oblivious to losses and correlations among the links, as it optimizes the performance without the explicit knowledge of these two factors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2322617"",""NSF(grant numbers:ECCS 1331018,CNS 1065444,CCF 1028167,CNS 0948184,CCF 0830289)"; Emirates Foundation(grant numbers:EF 2009/075);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6812230"",""Network coding";wireless networks;cross-layer design;coded feedback;feedback;"link correlation"",""Network coding";Routing;Correlation;Wireless communication;Protocols;Throughput;"Encoding"","""",""3"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""8 May 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One important research issue in large RFID systems is the identification of unknown tags, i.e., tags that just entered the system but have not been interrogated by reader(s) covering them yet. Unknown tag identification plays a critical role in automatic inventory management and misplaced tag discovery, but it is far from thoroughly investigated. Existing solutions either trivially interrogate all the tags in the system and thus are highly time inefficient due to re-identification of already identified tags, or use probabilistic approaches that cannot guarantee complete identification of all the unknown tags. In this paper, we propose a series of protocols that can identify all of the unknown tags with high time efficiency. We develop several novel techniques to quickly deactivate already identified tags and prevent them from replying during the interrogation of unknown tags, which avoids re-identification of these tags and consequently improves time efficiency. To our knowledge, our protocols are the first non-trivial solutions that guarantee complete identification of all the unknown tags. We illustrate the effectiveness of our protocols through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.

Such a high growth rate is expected to take us to exascale in the timeframe 2018-2022. But, to bring a productive exascale environment about, it is necessary to focus on several key challenges. One of those challenges is fault tolerance. Machines at extreme scale will experience frequent failures and will require the system to avoid or overcome those failures. Various techniques have recently been developed to tolerate failures. The impact of these techniques and their scalability can be substantially enhanced by a parallel programming model called migratable objects. In this paper, we demonstrate how the migratable-objects model facilitates and improves several fault tolerance approaches. Our experimental results on thousands of cores suggest fault tolerance schemes based on migratable objects have low performance overhead and high scalability.

Live migration of multi-tier applications across geographically distributed data centers is important for load management, power saving, routine server maintenance and quality-of-service. Different from a single-VM migration, VMs in a multi-tier application are closely correlated, which results in a correlated VM migrations problem. Current live migration algorithms for single-VM cause significant application performance degradation because intermediate data exchange between different VMs suffers relatively low bandwidth and high latency across distributed data centers. In this paper, we design and implement a coordination system called VMbuddies for correlated VM migrations in the cloud. Particularly, we propose an adaptive network bandwidth allocation algorithm to minimize the migration cost in terms of migration completion time, network traffic and migration downtime. Experiments using a public benchmark show that VMbuddies significantly reduces the performance degradation and migration cost of multi-tier applications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2316152"",""Singapore National Research Foundation"; Environment & Water Industry Programme Office(grant numbers:1002-IRIS-09);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784491"",""Cloud";live migration;multi-tier application;"virtual machine"",""Bandwidth";Channel allocation;Synchronization;Distributed databases;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;"Degradation"","""",""62"","""",""44"",""IEEE"",""8 Apr 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Data center energy saving not only helps control the operational cost, but also benefits the sustainable growth of cloud services. Due to the adoption of much more switches in modern data centers as well as the mature server-side power management techniques, energy saving for the data center network is becoming increasingly important. Most previous works on saving data center network energy focus on aggregating flows to as few switches as possible. However, in this paper we argue that this method may not work for network-limited flows, the throughputs of which are elastic based on the competing flows. To save the network energy consumed by this kind of elastic flows, we propose a flow scheduling approach called Willow, which takes both the number of switches involved and their active working durations into consideration. We formulate this problem by programming and design a greedy approximate algorithm to schedule flows in an online manner. Simulations based on MapReduce traces show that Willow can save up to 60 percent network energy compared with ECMP scheduling in typical settings, and outperforms other classical heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Testbed Experiments demonstrate that this kind of dynamic energy-efficient flow scheduling causes negligible impact on upper-layer applications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2350990"",""National Key Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB347800,2012CB315800)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61170291,61133006,61161140454); National High-tech R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2013AA013303);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882231"",""Data center network";energy efficiency;"flow scheduling"",""Servers";Routing;Throughput;Scheduling;Ports (Computers);Network topology;"Schedules"","""",""20"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""22 Aug 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
