A clustering approach for partitioning a network into clusters of richly-connected regions is proposed as a means of defining two performance-correlated characterization metrics: intercluster bandwidth index and intercluster link-cost index. The two characterization metrics are shown to have a strong correlation to saturation throughput when link and load distribution of a network is imbalanced. Simulation results also show that the clustering algorithm can be applied to a variety of network configurations and traffic scenarios, particularly irregular ones.

The power of these techniques stems from their capability in searching large search spaces, which arise in many combinatorial optimization problems, very efficiently. This paper compares several well-known artificial life techniques to gauge their suitability for solving location management problems. Due to their popularity and robustness, a genetic algorithm (GA), tabu search (TS), and ant colony algorithm (ACA) are used to solve the reporting cells planning problem.

Traditionally, exact loop bounds computation has not been performed because its complexity is doubly exponential on the number of loops in the multilevel tiled code and, therefore, for certain classes of loops (i.e., nonrectangular loop nests), can be extremely time consuming. Although computation of exact loop bounds is not very important when tiling only for cache levels, it is critical when tiling includes the register level. This paper presents an efficient implementation of multilevel tiling that computes exact loop bounds and has a much lower complexity than conventional techniques. To achieve this lower complexity, our technique deals simultaneously with all levels to be tiled, rather than applying tiling level by level as is usually done. For loop nests having very simple affine functions as bounds, results show that our method is between 15 and 28 times faster than conventional techniques. For loop nests caving not so simple bounds, we have measured speedups as high as 2,300. Additionally, our technique allows eliminating redundant bounds efficiently. Results show that eliminating redundant bounds in our method is between 22 and 11 times faster than in conventional techniques for typical linear algebra programs."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1239869"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1239869"","""",""Registers";Parallel processing;Linear algebra;Microprocessors;Bandwidth;Velocity measurement;Partitioning algorithms;"Memory architecture"","""",""7"",""2"",""26"",""IEEE"",""27 Oct 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has been noticed that multimedia applications can tolerate and gracefully adapt to transient fluctuations in the QoS that they receive from the network. The additional flexibility afforded by the ability of multimedia applications to tolerate and adapt to transient changes in QoS can be exploited by protocol designers to significantly improve the overall performance of wireless systems. This paper presents a fair resource allocation protocol for multimedia wireless networks that uses a combination of bandwidth reservation and bandwidth borrowing to provide network users with QoS in terms of guaranteed bandwidth, call blocking, and call dropping probabilities.

However, this approach is time-consuming and impractical for a video processing system that must perform a variety of different algorithms, with new algorithms being constantly developed. Improved support for program development is absolutely necessary before the full benefits of parallel architectures can be realized for video processing applications. Toward this goal, an automatic compile-time scheduler has been developed to schedule input tasks of video processing applications with precedence constraints onto available processors. The scheduler exploits both spatial (parallelism) and temporal (pipelining) concurrency to make the best use of machine resources. Two important scheduling problems are addressed. First, given a task graph and a desired throughput, a schedule is constructed to achieve the desired throughput with the minimum number of processors. Second, given a task graph and a finite set of available resources, a schedule is constructed such that the throughput is maximized while meeting the resource constraints. Results from simulations show that the scheduler and proposed optimization techniques effectively tackle these problems by maximizing processor utilization. A code generator has been developed to generate parallel programs automatically. The tools developed in this paper make it much easier for a programmer to develop video processing applications on these parallel architectures."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1178876"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178876"","""",""Scheduling algorithm";Processor scheduling;Throughput;Workstations;Parallel architectures;Hardware;Costs;Pipeline processing;Concurrent computing;"Programming profession"","""",""21"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""19 Feb 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most methods currently used for dealing with message-dependent deadlocks require more system resources than are necessary and/or do not use system resources efficiently. This may have an adverse effect on system performance if resources are scarce. In this paper, we characterize the frequency of message-dependent deadlocks in multiprocessor/multicomputer systems. We also propose a handling technique for message-dependent deadlocks based on progressive deadlock recovery and evaluate its performance with other approaches. Results show that message-dependent deadlocks occur very infrequently under typical circumstances thus, rendering approaches based on avoiding them overly restrictive in the common case.

The reason is that construction of minimal-cost tree spanning all members of the multicast group is expensive, hence these protocols use a core-based group-shared tree to distribute packets from all the sources. A core-based tree is a shortest-path tree rooted at some core node. The core node is also referred to as a center node or a rendezvous point. Core nodes may be chosen from some preselected set of nodes or some heuristics may be employed to select core nodes. We present distributed core selection and migration protocols for mobile ad hoc networks with dynamically changing network topology. Most protocols for core selection in static networks are not suitable for ad hoc networks, since these algorithms depend on knowledge of entire network topology, which is not available or is too expensive to maintain in an ad hoc network with dynamic topology. The proposed core location method is based on the notion of median node of the current multicast tree instead of the median node of the entire network. The rationale is that the mobile ad hoc network graphs are in general sparse and, hence, the multicast tree is a good approximation of the entire network for the current purpose. Our adaptive distributed core selection and migration method uses the fact that the median of a tree is equivalent to the centroid of that tree. The significance of this observation is due to the fact that the computation of a tree's centroids does not require any distance information. Mobile ad hoc networks have limited bandwidth which needs to be conserved. Hence, we use the cost of multicast tree as the sum of weights of all the links in the tree, which signifies the total bandwidth consumed for multicasting a packet. We compare the cost of shortest-path tree rooted at the tree median, Cost/sub TM/, with the cost of shortest-path tree rooted at the median of the graph, Cost/sub GM/, which requires complete topology information to compute. A network graph model for generating random ad hoc mobile networks is developed to perform this comparison. The simulation results show that for large size networks, the ratio Cost/sub TM//Cost/sub GM/ lies between 0.8 to 1.2 for different multicast groups.

Tiling or supernode transformation has been widely used to improve locality in multilevel memory hierarchies, as well as to efficiently execute loops onto parallel architectures. However, automatic code generation for tiled loops can be a very complex compiler work, especially when nonrectangular tile shapes and iteration space bounds are concerned. Our method considerably enhances previous work on rewriting tiled loops, by considering parallelepiped tiles and arbitrary iteration space shapes. In order to generate tiled code, we first enumerate all tiles containing points within the iteration space and, second, sweep all points within each tile.

The algorithm requires 2e messages and a delay of 2(d+1) message hops to detect if a node in a distributed graph is in a knot (here, e is the number of edges in the reachable part of the distributed graph and d is its diameter). A significant advantage of this algorithm is that it not only detects if a node is involved in a knot, but also finds exactly which nodes are involved in the knot. Moreover, if the node is not involved in a knot, but is only involved in a cycle, then it finds the nodes that are in a cycle with that node. We illustrate the working of the algorithm with examples.

A context-sensitive middleware provides the necessary support to context-sensitive application objects to participate in spontaneous and ad hoc communications with other applications in remote devices whenever suitable contexts exist. A context-sensitive middleware can provide this support effectively if its communication subsystem, such as an Object Request Broker (ORB), can properly discover other objects in devices. This capability is usually known as object discovery protocol. An energy-efficient object discovery protocol is needed to help prolong a device's battery life because many devices in ubiquitous computing environments are battery-powered and, thus, have limited energy sources. An energy-efficient object discovery protocol, RKS, for context-sensitive middleware for ubiquitous computing is presented. RKS reduces energy consumption by reducing the amount of information that needs to be sent to remote devices to discover objects. A novel feature of RKS is that it advertises its server-objects' availability only when it detects that these servers can be activated in the current context and when it finds that the neighbor devices have some potential clients that are willing to discover objects. Analytical comparisons of the energy-consumptions are given between RKS and two other protocols for object discovery in context-sensitive middleware. Furthermore, our experimental results, based on the implementations of these protocols and RKS on a context-sensitive middleware test bed, confirm our analytical results in that the RKS conserves more energy than the other two."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1247669"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247669"","""",""Energy efficiency";Protocols;Middleware;Ubiquitous computing;Context;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Batteries;Energy consumption;"Object detection"","""",""14"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""24 Nov 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Duplication heuristics are more effective, in general, for fine grain task graphs and for networks with high communication latencies. However, most of the available duplication algorithms are designed under the assumption of unbounded availability of fully connected processors, and lie in a high complexity range. Low complexity optimal duplication algorithms work under restricted cost and/or shape parameters for the task graphs. Further, the required number of processors grows in proportion to the task-graph size significantly. An improved duplication strategy is proposed that works for arbitrary task graphs, with a limited number of interconnection-constrained processors. Unlike most other algorithms that replicate all possible parents/ancestors of a given task, the proposed algorithm tends to avoid redundant duplications and duplicates the nodes selectively, only if it helps in improving the performance. This results in lower duplications and also lower time and space complexity. Simulation results are presented for clique and an interconnection-constrained network topology with random and regular benchmark task graph suites, representing a variety of parallel numerical applications. Performance, in terms of normalized schedule length and efficiency, is compared with some of the well-known and recently proposed algorithms.

Examining the model parameters provides insight into application behaviors and how they interact with the system. Second, we create a model that captures such heterogeneous processor behavior, which is important for analyzing memory system design tradeoffs. Highly bursty memory request traffic and lock contention are also modeled in a significantly more robust way than in previous work. With these features, the model is applicable to a wide range of architectures and applications. Although the features increase the model complexity, it is a useful design tool because the size of the model input parameter set remains manageable, and the model is still several orders of magnitude quicker to solve than detailed simulation. Validation results show that the model is highly accurate, producing heterogeneous per processor throughputs that are generally within 5 percent and, for the workloads validated, always within 13 percent of the values measured by detailed simulation with SimOS.

In this approach, a user thread runs on a general-purpose processor in main memory, either in the memory controller chip or in a DRAM chip. The thread performs correlation prefetching in software, sending the prefetched data into the L2 cache of the main processor. This approach requires minimal hardware beyond the memory processor: The correlation table is a software data structure that resides in main memory, while the main processor only needs a few modifications to its L2 cache so that it can accept incoming prefetches. In addition, the approach has wide applicability, as it can effectively prefetch even for irregular applications. Finally, it is very flexible, as the prefetching algorithm can be customized by the user on an application basis. Our simulation results show that, through a new design of the correlation table and prefetching algorithm, our scheme delivers good results. Specifically, nine mostly-irregular applications show an average speedup of 1.32. Furthermore, our scheme works well in combination with a conventional processor-side sequential prefetcher, in which case the average speedup increases to 1.46.

However, carrier sensing has not been utilized and suitable acknowledgment schemes for the algorithms are not developed. Moreover, the assumption taken by Nakano et al. about MSs being able to listen while transmitting is not valid for ad hoc networks. In this context, we describe two algorithms for initializing an ad hoc network with carrier sensing capability. First, a novel acknowledgment scheme is proposed for notifying a transmitting MS whether its transmission is successful during the initialization. Then, two distributed and randomized initialization algorithms are developed and analyzed, under the assumptions of a known and unknown number of users in the network, respectively. Both algorithms are obtained based on optimizing some key parameters to minimize the total time required to complete the initialization.

The goal of this work is to design a general """"front-end"""" algorithm that uses these two building blocks to support a new Web service model, namely, multiclass services which control response latencies to within prespecified targets. Our key technique is to devise a general service abstraction to adaptively control not only the latency of a particular class, but also to bound the interclass relationships. In this way, we capture the extent to which classes are isolated or share system resources (as determined by the server architecture and system internals) and hence their effects on each other's QoS. For example, if the server provides class isolation (i.e., a minimum fraction of system resources independent of other classes), yet also allows a class to utilize unused resources from other classes, the algorithm infers and exploits this behavior, without an explicit low level model of the server. Thus, as new functionalities are incorporated into Web servers, the approach naturally exploits their properties to efficiently satisfy the classes' performance targets.

Traditionally, deadlock-avoidance strategies have been used. In this case, either routing is restricted so that there are no cyclic dependencies between channels or cyclic dependencies between channels are allowed provided that there are some escape paths to avoid deadlock. More recently, deadlock recovery strategies have begun to gain acceptance. These strategies allow the use of unrestricted fully adaptive routing, usually outperforming deadlock avoidance techniques. However, they require a deadlock detection mechanism and a deadlock recovery mechanism that is able to recover from deadlocks faster than they occur. In particular, progressive deadlock recovery techniques are very attractive because they allocate a few dedicated resources to quickly deliver deadlocked messages, instead of killing them. Unfortunately, distributed deadlock detection is usually based on crude time-outs, which detect many false deadlocks. As a consequence, messages detected as deadlocked may saturate the bandwidth offered by recovery resources, thus degrading performance. Additionally, the threshold required by the detection mechanism (the time-out) strongly depends on network load, which is not known in advance at the design stage. This limits the applicability of deadlock recovery on actual networks. We propose a novel distributed deadlock detection mechanism that uses only local information, detects all the deadlocks, considerably reduces the probability of false deadlock detection over previously proposed techniques, and is not significantly affected by variations in message length and/or message destination distribution."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1225056"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225056"","""",""Distributed control";System recovery;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Routing;Intelligent networks;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Computer Society;Resource management;"Bandwidth"","""",""24"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""26 Aug 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is characterized by a transformation matrix and a vector of moduli, called the modulus vector. Modular mappings are useful to derive parallel versions of algorithms with commutative operations and algorithms intended for execution on processor arrays with toroidal networks. In order to preserve algorithm correctness, modular mappings must be injective. Results of previous work characterize injective modular mappings of rectangular index sets. This paper provides a technique to generate modular mappings that satisfy these injective conditions and extends the results to general index sets. For an n-dimensional rectangular index set, the technique has O(n/sup 2/n!) complexity. To facilitate generation of efficient code, modular mappings must also be reversible (i.e., have easily described inverses). An O(n/sup 2/) method is provided to generate reversible modular mappings. This method reduces the search space by fixing entries of the modulus vector while attempting to minimize the number of entries to exclude few solutions. For general index sets defined by linear inequalities, injectivity can be checked by formulating and solving a set of linear inequalities. A modified Fourier-Motzkin elimination is proposed to solve these inequalities. To generate an injective modular mapping of an index set defined by linear inequalities, this paper proposes a technique that attempts to minimize the values of the entries of the modulus vector. Several examples are provided to illustrate the application of the above mentioned methods, including the case of BLAS routines."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1167366"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167366"","""",""Signal processing algorithms";Vectors;Concurrent computing;Systolic arrays;Computer networks;Parallel processing;Signal mapping;Testing;Linear algebra;"Control systems"","""",""3"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""29 Jan 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, it is well-known that the spanning ratios of these two graphs are not bounded by any constant (even for uniform randomly distributed points). Bose et al. (1999) recently developed a localized routing protocol that guarantees that the distance traveled by the packets is within a constant factor of the minimum if Delaunay triangulation of all wireless nodes is used, in addition, to guarantee the delivery of the packets. However, it is expensive to construct the Delaunay triangulation in a distributed manner. Given a set of wireless nodes, we model the network as a unit-disk graph (UDG), in which a link uv exists only if the distance /spl par/uv/spl par/ is at most the maximum transmission range. In this paper, we present a novel localized networking protocol that constructs a planar 2 5-spanner of UDG, called the localized Delaunay triangulation (LDEL), as network topology. It contains all edges that are both in the unit-disk graph and the Delaunay triangulation of all nodes. The total communication cost of our networking protocol is O(n log n) bits, which is within a constant factor of the optimum to construct any structure in a distributed manner. Our experiments show that the delivery rates of some of the existing localized routing protocols are increased when localized Delaunay triangulation is used instead of several previously proposed topologies.

Compared with two such representative ones, our protocols improve efficiency in two different ways. First, utilizing trusted third parties and aiming at both reliability and low-cost, we propose a group of mutual anonymity protocols. We show that with some limited central support, our protocols can accomplish the goals of anonymity, efficiency, and reliability. Second, we propose a mutual anonymity protocol which relies solely on self-organizations among peers without any trusted central controls. In this protocol, the returning path can be shorter than the requesting path. This protocol does not need to broadcast the requested file back to the requester so that the bandwidth is saved and efficiency is improved.

Since this system is written completely in Java, it is portable and allows executing programs in parallel across multiple heterogeneous platforms. With the middleware infrastructure, users need not deal with the mechanisms of deploying and loading user classes on the heterogeneous system. Moreover, details of scheduling, controlling, monitoring, and executing user jobs are hidden, while the management of system resources is made transparent to the user. Such uniform services are essential for facilitating the development and deployment of scalable high-performance Java applications on clusters and heterogeneous systems.

While the transcoding proxy is attracting an increasing amount of attention in this environment, it is noted that new caching strategies are required for these transcoding proxies. We propose an efficient cache replacement algorithm for transcoding proxies. Specifically, we formulate a generalized profit function to evaluate the profit from caching each version of an object. This generalized profit function explicitly considers several new emerging factors in the transcoding proxy and the aggregate effect of caching multiple versions of the same object. It is noted that the aggregate effect is not simply the sum of the costs of caching individual versions of an object, but rather, depends on the transcoding relationship among these versions. The notion of a weighted transcoding graph is devised to evaluate the corresponding aggregate effect efficiently. Utilizing the generalized profit function and the weighted transcoding graph, we propose, in this paper, an innovative cache replacement algorithm for transcoding proxies. In addition, an effective data structure is designed to facilitate the management of the multiple versions of different objects cached in the transcoding proxy. Using an event-driven simulation, it is shown that the algorithm proposed consistently outperforms companion schemes in terms of the delay saving ratios and cache hit ratios."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1206507"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206507"","""",""Aggregates";Transcoding;Personal digital assistants;Internet;Home appliances;Cellular phones;Costs;Data structures;Discrete event simulation;"Delay"","""",""54"",""1"",""26"",""IEEE"",""20 Jun 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the effects of placing application or kernel-level functionality, like packet scheduling on NIs, rather than the host machines to which they are attached. The main benefits of such placement are: 1) that traffic is eliminated from the host bus and memory subsystem, thereby allowing increased host CPU utilization for other tasks, and 2) that NI-based scheduling is immune to host-CPU loading, unlike host-based media schedulers that are easily affected even by transient load conditions.

The most crucial RDT characterizations introduced in the literature can be represented as certain types of RDT-PXCM-paths. Here, let the U-path and V-path be any two types of RDT-PXCM-paths. We investigate several properties of communication-induced checkpointing protocols that ensure the RDT property. First, we prove that if an online RDT protocol encounters a U-path at a point of a checkpoint and communication pattern associated with a distributed computation, it also encounters a V-path there. Moreover, if this encountered U-path is invisibly doubled, the corresponding encountered V-path is invisibly doubled as well. Therefore, we can conclude that breaking all invisibly doubled U-paths is equivalent to breaking all invisibly doubled V-paths for an online RDT protocol. Next, we continue to demonstrate that a visibly doubled U-path must contain a doubled U-cycle in the causal past. These results can further deduce that some different checkpointing protocols actually have the same behavior for all possible patterns. Finally, we present a commendatory systematic technique for comparing the performance of online RDT protocols."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1225055"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225055"","""",""Checkpointing";Protocols;Distributed computing;Communication system control;Fault tolerant systems;Computer networks;Communication networks;Nonvolatile memory;Process control;"Force control"","""",""9"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""26 Aug 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We exploit a simple and efficient packet injection mechanism to avoid deadlock, which leads to a fully, adaptive routing by employing only three virtual channels. In addition, we selectively use output buffers for implementing the most utilized virtual paths in order to reduce head-of-line blocking. The careful implementation of these features has resulted in a good trade-off between the network performance and hardware cost. The outcome of this research is a high-performance adaptive router (HPAR), which adequately balances the needs of parallel applications: minimal network latency at low loads and high throughput at heavy loads. The paper includes an evaluation process in which HPAR is compared with other adaptive routers using FIFO input bufferring, with or without additional virtual channels to reduce head-of-line blocking. This evaluation contemplates both the VLSI costs of each router and their performance under synthetic and real application workloads. To make the comparison fair, all the routers use the same efficient deadlock avoidance mechanism. In all the experiments, HPAR exhibited the best response among all the routers tested. Moreover, the observed packet latencies were comparable to those exhibited by simpler routers. Therefore, HPAR can be considered as a suitable candidate to implement packet interchange in next generations of CC-NUMA multiprocessors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1199066"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199066"","""",""Throughput";Routing;System recovery;Costs;Hardware;Delay;Computer Society;Telecommunication traffic;Computer architecture;"Multiprocessing systems"","""",""6"",""1"",""29"",""IEEE"",""21 May 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Tiling is a well-known compiler optimization that improves performance on such loops, particularly for computers with a multilevel hierarchy of parallelism and memory. Most previous work on tiling is limited in at least one of the following ways: they only handle nested loops of depth two, orthogonal tiling, or rectangular tiles. In our work, we tile loop nests of arbitrary depth using polyhedral tiles. We derive a prediction formula for the execution time of such tiled loops, which can be used by a compiler to automatically determine the tiling parameters that minimizes the execution time. We also explain the notion of rise, a measure of the relationship between the shape of the tiles and the shape of the iteration space generated by the loop nest. The rise is a powerful tool in predicting the execution time of a tiled loop. It allows us to reason about how the tiling affects the length of the longest path of dependent tiles, which is a measure of the execution time of a tiling. We use a model of the tiled iteration space that allows us to determine the length of the longest path of dependent tiles using linear programming.

For dynamic bulk synchronous computations that exhibit varying phase-wise computational requirements, remapping at runtime is an effective approach to ensure parallel efficiency. The paper introduces a novel remapping strategy for computations whose workload changes can be modeled as a Markov chain. The use of a Markovian model allows us to treat statistical dependence and more complex structure than the usual independent identically distributed random variable assumptions. Our models are quite general and we do not need to impose conditions on the dynamics of the underlying process other than the transition probability matrix. It is shown that optimal remapping can be formulated as a binary decision process: remap or not at a given synchronizing instant. The optimal strategy is then developed for long lasting computations by employing optimal stopping rules in a stochastic control framework. The existence of optimal controls is established. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality are obtained. Furthermore, a policy iteration algorithm is devised to reduce computational complexity and enhance fast convergence to the desired optimal control."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1167370"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167370"","""",""Stochastic processes";Optimal control;Concurrent computing;Computational modeling;Runtime;Peer to peer computing;Dynamic scheduling;Computational fluid dynamics;Random variables;"Probability"","""",""9"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""29 Jan 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Divisible loads are computations that can be divided into parts of arbitrary sizes and these parts can be independently processed in a distributed system. The problem is to partition the load so that the total processing time, including communications and computations, is the shortest possible. Earlier works in the divisible load theory assumed distributed systems with a flat memory model. The dependence of the processing time on the size of the assigned load was assumed to be linear. A new mathematical model relaxing the above two assumptions is proposed in this article. We study distributed systems-which have both the hierarchical memory model and a piecewise linear dependence of the processing time on the size of the assigned load. Performance of such systems is modeled and evaluated. Finally, we compare the efficiency of distributed processing divisible loads in multiinstallment and out-of-core modes. Multiinstallment processing consists in sending multiple small chunks of the load to processors instead of a single chunk which needs external memory.

As I/O-intensive gangs make light use of the CPU, this only causes a minor degradation in the service to compute-bound jobs.

Large coherence units are helpful in exploiting spatial locality, but worsen the effects of false sharing. A mathematical framework that allows a clean description of the relationship between spatial locality and false sharing is derived in this paper. First, a technique to identify a severe form of multiple-writer false sharing is presented. The importance of the interaction between optimization techniques aimed at enhancing locality and the techniques oriented toward reducing false sharing is then demonstrated. Given the conflicting requirements, a compiler-based approach to this problem holds promise. This paper investigates the use of data transformations in addressing spatial locality and false sharing, and derives an approach that balances the impact of the two. Experimental results demonstrate that such a balanced approach outperforms those approaches that consider only one of these two issues. On an eight-processor SGI/Cray Origin 2000 multiprocessor, our approach brings an additional 9 percent improvement over a powerful locality optimization technique that uses both loop and data transformations. The presented approach also obtains an additional 19 percent improvement over an optimization technique that is oriented specifically toward reducing false sharing.

They have been very successful in solving distributed computing problems for a large family of application domains. The architecture of middleware systems have gone through many significant cycles of evolution, both in terms of the completeness of functionality and the range of adoptions for different types of platforms. However, at the same time, it is getting increasingly difficult to achieve and to maintain a high level of adaptability and configurability because the structure of the middleware architecture is becoming overly complicated and rigid. We attribute that problem to the limitations of traditional software decomposition methods. Aspect-oriented programming, on the contrary, has introduced new design perspectives that permit the superimpositions of different abstraction models on top of one another. This is a very powerful technique for separating and simplifying design concerns. In our effort of applying principles of aspect orientation to the middleware architecture, we first pragmatically analyze the use of aspects in the middleware architecture. We then show that aspects are the correct remedy for the above outlined middleware problems by quantifying crosscutting concerns in the legacy implementations of several prominent middleware systems. Our aspect analysis results strongly indicate that modularity of middleware architecture is greatly hindered by the wide existence of tangled logic. To go one step further, we factor out a number of crosscutting concerns identified in the mining process, reimplement them as aspects, and superimpose them back into the refactored architecture. This allows us to use a set of software engineering metrics to quantify the refactorization in terms of changes in the structural complexity, modularity, and performance of the resulting system. This aspect-oriented refactoring proves that aspect orientation is capable of composing orthogonal design requirements. The final """"woven"""" system is able to correctly provide both the fundamental functionality and the """"aspectized"""" functionality with negligible overhead and an overall leaner architecture. Furthermore, the """"aspectized"""" feature can be configured in and out during compile-time, which greatly enhances the configurability of the architecture."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1247668"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247668"","""",""Middleware";Computer architecture;Distributed computing;Logic;Software engineering;Runtime;Availability;Space technology;Jacobian matrices;"Web services"","""",""37"",""3"",""26"",""IEEE"",""24 Nov 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Distributed Web systems can use a request redirection mechanism as second-level dispatching because the DNS routing scheme has limited control on offered load. Redirection is always executed by the servers, but there are many alternatives that are worth investigating. We explore the combination of DNS dispatching with redirection schemes that use centralized or distributed control on the basis of global or local state information. In fully distributed schemes, DNS dispatching is carried out by simple algorithms because load sharing is taken by some redirection mechanisms that each server activates autonomously. On the other hand, in fully centralized schemes, redirection is used as a tool to enforce decisions taken by the same centralized entity that provides the first-level dispatching. We also investigate hybrid strategies. We conclude that distributed algorithms are preferable over their centralized counterpart because they provide stable performance, take content-aware dispatching decisions, limit the percentage of redirected requests, and their implementation is much simpler than that required by centralized schemes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1195408"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195408"","""",""Dispatching";Network servers;Computer Society;Domain Name System;Routing;Load management;Delay;Service oriented architecture;Control systems;"Distributed control"","""",""56"","""",""24"",""IEEE"",""22 Apr 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These scheduling techniques reclaim the time unused by a task to reduce the execution speed of future tasks and, thus, reduce the total energy consumption of the system. We also study the effect of discrete voltage/speed levels on the energy savings for multiprocessor systems and propose a new scheme of slack reservation to incorporate voltage/speed adjustment overhead in the scheduling algorithms. Simulation and trace-based results indicate that our algorithms achieve substantial energy savings on systems with variable voltage processors.

For loops with control flows, however, software pipelining is not straightforward because we need to consider the overlap of more than one execution path. Modulo scheduling simply transforms them into straightline loops through if-conversion which, in effect, achieves a fixed, worst-case initiation interval (/spl par/) among all paths. On the other hand, all-path pipelining (APP) and enhanced pipeline scheduling (EPS) can achieve a variable /spl par/ depending on the path that is taken at execution time. Unfortunately, APP concentrates only on the overlap within the same path, entirely losing the overlap between different paths, whereas EPS attempts to overlap all paths together, failing to produce a tight schedule for each individual path, especially when resource constraints are tight. In this paper, we propose a new approach to EPS called split-path EPS (SP-EPS), which first splits each individual path via tail duplication and then performs EPS in a way to guarantee a tight schedule for each path, while producing a competitive cross-path schedule. We also extend SP-EPS to outer loops such that frequent paths that bypass the inner loop are split and then scheduled by SP-EPS. Our experimental results on nontrivial integer benchmarks show that SP-EPS can achieve as much as a geometric mean of 10 percent speedup over EPS when innermost loops are scheduled by SP-EPS, while it can achieve a geometric mean of 11.9 percent speedup when outer loops are also scheduled by SP-EPS."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1199063"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199063"","""",""Pipeline processing";Processor scheduling;Microprocessors;Moon;Throughput;Tail;"Kernel"","""",""1"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""21 May 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The multiple access nature of Ethernet makes it impossible to guarantee a deterministic medium access time (hence, packet-delivery deadlines) to individual stations. However, one can bound the medium access time statistically by limiting the packet-arrival rate at the medium access control (MAC) layer. While considering automated manufacturing systems as the main target application, this paper addresses the connection admission control (CAC) problem for statistically bounding the medium access time of Ethernet. Specifically, a packet is guaranteed to have a medium access time smaller than a predefined bound with a certain probability if the instantaneous packet-arrival rate is kept below a certain threshold. Through a mathematical analysis, we first derived such a threshold. In order to keep the packet-arrival rate under the given threshold, we developed and installed middleware which 1) resides between the transport layer and the Ethernet datalink layer, and 2) smooths packet streams between them. The implementation of this middleware requires only a minimal change in the OS kernel without modification to the current standard of Ethernet MAC protocol or TCP or UDP/IP stack. In order to solve the CAC problem, we derived the probability of transmitting a packet successfully upon each trial by modeling the MAC protocol, 1-persistent CSMA/CD, and the collision resolution protocol inary exponential backoff - of Ethernet. Our in-depth simulation results have shown this analytic model to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of packet-loss (or deadline-miss) ratio over fast Ethernet. Finally, we implemented the middleware on the Linux OS, experimentally demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in providing real-time communication over Ethernet."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1189588"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189588"","""",""Ethernet networks";Media Access Protocol;Middleware;Manufacturing systems;Admission control;Probability;Mathematical analysis;Kernel;TCPIP;"Multiaccess communication"","""",""21"","""",""16"",""IEEE"",""26 Mar 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Apart from simulation, PAMELA features a symbolic analysis technique that enables PAMELA models to be compiled into symbolic performance models that trade prediction accuracy for the lowest possible solution cost. We demonstrate our approach through a large number of theoretical and practical modeling case studies, including six parallel programs and two distributed-memory machines. The average prediction error of our approach is less than 10 percent, while the average worst-case error is limited to 50 percent. It is shown that this accuracy is sufficient to correctly select the best coding or partitioning strategy. For programs expressed in a high-level, structured programming model, such as data-parallel programs, symbolic performance modeling can be entirely automated. We report on experiments with a PAMELA model generator built within a dataparallel compiler for distributed-memory machines. Our results show that with negligible program annotation, symbolic performance models are automatically compiled in seconds, while their solution cost is in the order of milliseconds."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1178879"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178879"","""",""Costs";Predictive models;Accuracy;Performance analysis;Design engineering;Feedback;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;High performance computing;"Computer Society"","""",""30"","""",""39"",""IEEE"",""19 Feb 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The behavior of these applications is often constrained by the physical world. It is therefore important to devise higher-level languages and middleware that meet conventional functional requirements, as well as dependably and productively enforce real-time constraints. We provide two contributions to the study of languages and middleware for real-time and embedded applications. We first describe the architecture of jRate, which is an open-source ahead-of-time-compiled implementation of the RTSJ middleware. We then show performance results obtained using RTJPerf, which is an open-source benchmarking suite that systematically compares the performance of RTSJ middleware implementations. We show that, while research remains to be done to make RTSJ a bullet-proof technology, the initial results are promising. The performance and predictability of JRate provides a baseline for what can be achieved by using ahead-of-time compilation. Likewise, RTJPerf enables researchers and practitioners to evaluate the pros and cons of RTSJ middleware systematically as implementations mature."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1247675"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247675"","""",""Java";Middleware;Real time systems;Embedded system;Memory management;Control systems;Embedded software;Microprocessors;Open source software;"Biology computing"","""",""13"","""",""19"",""IEEE"",""24 Nov 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we analyze cache and translation look-aside buffer (TLB) performance of such alternate layouts (including block data layout and Morton layout) when used in conjunction with tiling. We derive a tight lower bound on TLB performance for standard matrix access patterns, and show that block data layout and Morton layout achieve this bound. To improve cache performance, block data layout is used in concert with tiling. Based on the cache and TLB performance analysis, we propose a data block size selection algorithm that finds a tight range for optimal block size. To validate our analysis, we conducted simulations and experiments using tiled matrix multiplication, LU decomposition, and Cholesky factorization. For matrix multiplication, simulation results using UltraSparc II parameters show that tiling and block data layout with a block size given by our block size selection algorithm, reduces up to 93 percent of TLB misses compared with other techniques. The total miss cost is reduced considerably. Experiments on several platforms show that tiling with block data layout achieves up to 50 percent performance improvement over other techniques that use conventional layouts. Morton layout is also analyzed and compared with block data layout. Experimental results show that matrix multiplication using block data layout is up to 15 percent faster than that using Morton data layout."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1214317"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214317"","""",""Hardware";Performance analysis;Matrix decomposition;Delay;Degradation;Analytical models;Costs;Programming profession;"Streaming media"","""",""74"",""1"",""28"",""IEEE"",""22 Jul 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on the concept of layer-4 service differentiation and resource isolation, where the transport-layer information is inferred from the IP headers and used for packet classification and resource management, we present a transport-aware IP (tIP) router architecture that provides fine-grained service differentiation and resource isolation among different classes of traffic aggregates. The tIP router architecture consists of a fine-grained Quality-of-Service (QoS) classifier and an adaptive weight-based resource manager. A two-stage packet-classification mechanism is devised to decouple the fine-grained QoS lookup from the usual routing lookup at core routers. The fine-grained service differentiation and resource isolation provided inside the tIP router is a powerful built-in protection mechanism to counter DDoS attacks, reducing the vulnerability of Internet to DDoS attacks. Moreover, the tIP architecture is stateless and compatible with the Differentiated Service (DiffServ) infrastructure. Thanks to its scalable QoS support for TCP control segments, the tIP router supports bidirectional differentiated services for TCP sessions."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1233710"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233710"","""",""Protection";Counting circuits;Computer crime;Web and internet services;Resource management;Availability;Aggregates;Quality of service;Quality management;"Routing"","""",""25"",""13"",""48"",""IEEE"",""29 Sep 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Verifying sequential consistency on shared-memory multiprocessors by model checking,""S.

A memory model is typically implemented by means of a cache-coherence protocol. The design of this protocol is one of the most complex aspects of multiprocessor design and is consequently quite error-prone. However, it is imperative to ensure that the cache-coherence protocol satisfies the shared-memory model. We present a novel technique based on model checking to tackle this difficult problem for the important and well-known shared-memory model of sequential consistency. Surprisingly, verifying sequential consistency is undecidable in general, even for finite-state cache-coherence protocols. In practice, cache-coherence protocols satisfy the properties of causality and data independence. Causality is the property that values of read events flow from values of write events. Data independence is the property that all traces can be generated by renaming data values from traces where the written values are pairwise distinct. We show that, if a causal and data independent system also has the property that the logical order of write events to each location is identical to their temporal order, then sequential consistency is decidable. We present a novel model checking algorithm to verify sequential consistency on such systems for a finite number of processors and memory locations and an arbitrary number of data values."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1225053"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225053"","""",""Protocols";Read-write memory;Formal verification;Contracts;Programming profession;Reasoning about programs;Hardware;Design optimization;Face detection;"Humans"","""",""32"","""",""35"",""IEEE"",""26 Aug 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When the job is moldable (i.e., there is a choice on how many processors the job uses), an application scheduler called SA can significantly improve job performance by automatically selecting how many processors to use. Since most jobs are moldable, this result has great impact to the current state of practice in supercomputer scheduling. However, the widespread use of SA can change the nature of workload processed by supercomputers. When many SAs are scheduling jobs on one supercomputer, the decision made by one SA affects the state of the system, therefore impacting other instances of SA. In this case, the global behavior of the system comes from the aggregate behavior caused by all SAs. In particular, it is reasonable to expect the competition for resources to become tougher with multiple SAs, and this tough competition to decrease the performance improvement attained by each SA individually. This paper investigates this very issue. We found that the increased competition indeed makes it harder for each individual instance of SA to improve job performance. Nevertheless, there are two other aggregate behaviors that override increased competition when the system load is moderate to heavy. First, as load goes up, SA chooses smaller requests, which increases efficiency, which effectively decreases the offered load, which mitigates long wait times. Second, better job packing and fewer jobs in the system make it easier for incoming jobs to fit in the supercomputer schedule, thus reducing wait times further. As a result, in moderate to heavy load conditions, a single instance of SA benefits from the fact that other jobs are also using SA."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1178881"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178881"","""",""Aggregates";Supercomputers;Processor scheduling;"Job design"","""",""26"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""19 Feb 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
