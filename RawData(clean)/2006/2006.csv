Traditional interconnects like buses, point-to-point wires, and regular topologies may suffer from poor resource sharing in the time and space domains, leading to high contention or low resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for constructing networks for special-purpose computer systems with well-behaved (known) communication characteristics. A temporal and spatial model is proposed to define the sufficient condition for contention-free communication. Based upon this model, a design methodology using a recursive bisection technique is applied to systematically partition a parallel system such that the required number of links and switches is minimized while achieving low contention. Results show that the design methodology can generate more optimized on-chip networks with up to 60 percent fewer resources than meshes or tori while providing blocking performance closer to that of a fully connected crossbar."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.15"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1566595"",""On-chip interconnects";communication model;low-contention communication;network partitioning;"irregular topology."",""Design methodology";Resource management;Wires;Network topology;Computer networks;Sufficient conditions;Switches;Communication switching;Design optimization;"Network-on-a-chip"","""",""23"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""3 Jan 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

PBAU is not a mere Verilog HDL translation of BA, but a novel, fully hardware-oriented implementation exploiting maximum hardware parallelism of all computations in BA, resulting in O(1) runtime complexity in the best case and O(n) in the worst. PBAU is an Intellectual Property (IP) block that provides a mechanism of very fast, automatic deadlock avoidance for Multiprocessor System-on-a-Chip (MPSoC), which we predict will be the mainstream of future high performance computing environments. Furthermore, our PBAU supports multiple instance multiple resource systems. We demonstrate that PBAU not only avoids deadlock in a few clock cycles (several orders of magnitude faster than BA in software), but also achieves, in a particular example, a 19 percent speedup of application execution time over avoiding deadlock in software.

Accordingly, we develop a data transfer technique for simplifying routers for predictable small-sized communication in simple tile-based architectures. A data structure is split into single-flit packets, and a label is attached to each of them in order to route them independently. A label is transferred on dedicated wires beside data lines in a channel by taking advantage of relaxed pin count limitations of a channel. To reduce the wiring area for the label, the label is locally assigned according to a preanalysis of required communication pairs of nodes. Analysis results show that only a 3-bit local label is sufficient to route all data of evaluated streaming applications in the case of a 16-node 2D torus.

To achieve strong replica consistency in multithreaded environments, this paper proposes intercepting mutex lock/unlock operations performed by threads on accessing the shared data and contributes with two algorithmic solutions: 1) a loose synchronization algorithm (LSA), which captures the natural concurrency in a leader replica and projects it on follower replicas through interreplica communication, and 2) a preemptive deterministic scheduler (PDS) algorithm, which removes the need for interreplica communication through the notion of round and by suspending threads when it is unable (yet) to schedule them deterministically. Failure behavior and performance of LSA and PDS implementations are evaluated in a triplicated system and compared with existing solutions. A performance evaluation indicates that LSA and PDS outperform existing solutions, with PDS offering lower throughput than LSA. A fault-injection campaign shows that PDS is more robust to errors due to the absence of interreplica communication. Hence, LSA and PDS represent a trade-off between performance and dependability. Finally, LSA and PDS are demonstrated in replicating the Apache Web server, a substantial real-world application."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.56"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613853"",""Fault tolerance";replication;multithreading;nondeterminism;"fault injection."",""Scheduling algorithm";Multithreading;Concurrent computing;Robustness;Interleaved codes;Throughput;Web server;Fault tolerance;"Redundancy"","""",""30"",""1"",""24"",""IEEE"",""3 Apr 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we address the issue of partitioning such a complex algorithm while the energy consumption due to wireless transmission is minimized. ECG analysis algorithms normally consist of preprocessing, pattern recognition, and classification. Considering the orientation of the ECG leads, we devise a technique to perform preprocessing and pattern recognition locally in small embedded systems attached to the leads. The features detected in the pattern recognition phase are considered for the classification. Ideally, if the features detected for each heartbeat reside in a single processing node, the transmission will be unnecessary. Otherwise, to perform classification, the features must be gathered on a local node and, thus, the communication is inevitable. We perform such a feature grouping by modeling the problem as a hypergraph and applying partitioning schemes which yield a significant power saving in wireless communications. Furthermore, we utilize dynamic reconfiguration by software module migration. This technique, with respect to partitioning, enhances the overall power saving in such systems. Moreover, it adaptively alters the system configuration in various environments and on different patients.

We extend Chord and Koorde to be capacity-aware. We then embed implicit degree-varying multicast trees on top of the overlay network and develop multicast routines that automatically follow the trees to disseminate multicast messages.

In the current designs, routing is not congestion-adaptive. Routing may let a congestion happen which is detected by congestion control, but dealing with congestion in this reactive manner results in longer delay and unnecessary packet loss and requires significant overhead if a new route is needed. This problem becomes more visible especially in large-scale transmission of heavy traffic such as multimedia data, where congestion is more probable and the negative impact of packet loss on the service quality is of more significance. We argue that routing should not only be aware of, but also be adaptive to, network congestion. Hence, we propose a routing protocol (CRP) with such properties.

This paper proposes a congestion-avoidance scheme based on lightweight buffer management. We describe simple yet effective approaches that prevent data packets from overflowing the buffer space of the intermediate sensors. These approaches automatically adapt the sensors' forwarding rates to nearly optimal without causing congestion. We discuss how to implement buffer-based congestion avoidance with different MAC protocols.

Guided by the same function, adaptive search selectively forwards queries to """"matched"""" peers with a high probability of caching the desired indices.

A stampede program is a data flow graph of threads and channels. Stampede semantics for channels allow concurrent access from multiple threads for input and output. While a channel holds timestamped items, the semantics do not place any restriction on either the production or consumption order of these items.

However, popular implementations of epidemic-style dissemination suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) Network overhead: when deployed on a WAN-wide or VPN-wide scale, they generate a large number of packets that transit across the boundaries of multiple network domains (e.g., LANs, subnets, ASs), causing an overload on core network elements such as bridges, routers, and associated links. 2) Lack of adaptivity: they impose the same load on process group members and the network even under reduced failure rates (viz., packet losses, process failures). In this paper, we describe two protocols to address these problems: 1) a hierarchical gossiping protocol and 2) an adaptive dissemination framework (for multicasts) that allows use of any gossiping primitive within it. These protocols work within a virtual peer-to-peer hierarchy called the leaf box hierarchy.

However, applications of directional antennas for broadcasting have been limited. We propose a novel broadcast protocol called directional self-pruning (DSP) for ad hoc wireless networks using directional antennas. DSP is a nontrivial generalization of an existing localized deterministic broadcast protocol using omnidirectional antennas. Compared with its omnidirectional predecessor, DSP uses about the same number of forward nodes to relay the broadcast packet, while the number of forward directions that each forward node uses in transmission is significantly reduced. With the lower broadcast redundancy, DSP is more bandwidth and energy-efficient. DSP is based on 2-hop neighborhood information and does not rely on location or angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. Two special cases of DSP are discussed: the first one preserves shortest paths in reactive routing discoveries";" the second one uses the directional reception mode to minimize broadcast redundancy. DSP is a localized protocol. Its expected number of forward nodes is O(1) times the optimal value. An extensive simulation study using both custom and ns2 simulators show that DSP significantly outperforms both omnidirectional broadcast protocols and existing directional broadcast protocols."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.46"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603517"",""Ad hoc wireless networks";broadcasting;directional antennas;localized algorithms;self-pruning;"simulation."",""Broadcasting";Wireless networks;Directional antennas;Digital signal processing;Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Ad hoc networks;Wireless application protocol;Relays;"Energy efficiency"","""",""76"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""6 Mar 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we first show that previous methods specifically designed to minimize the backbone size may produce a backbone with large cost. Then, an efficient distributed method to construct a weighted backbone with low cost is proposed. We prove that the total cost of the constructed backbone is within a small constant factor of the optimum for homogeneous networks when either the nodes' costs are smooth (i.e., the maximum ratio of costs of adjacent nodes is bounded) or the network maximum node degree is bounded.

The key idea is that GES uses a distributed topology adaptation algorithm to organize semantically relevant nodes into same semantic groups by using the notion of node vector. Given a query, GES employs an efficient search protocol to direct the query to the most relevant semantic groups for answers, thereby achieving high recall with probing only a small fraction of nodes. To the best of our knowledge, GES is the first to identify node vector size as an important role in impacting search performance and to show that the node vector size offers a good trade-off between search performance and bandwidth cost. Moreover, GES adopts automatic query expansion and local data clustering to improve search performance. We show that GES is efficient and even outperforms the centralized node clustering system SETS. For example, in the scenario where node capacity is heterogeneous, GES can achieve 73 percent recall when probing only 20 percent nodes, outperforming SETS by about 18 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.173"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717409"",""Peer-to-peer";topology adaptation;biased walk;semantic group;node vector;recall;"information retrieval."",""Peer to peer computing";Information retrieval;Network topology;Bandwidth;Protocols;Costs;IP networks;Distributed computing;Computational efficiency;"Keyword search"","""",""32"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""30 Oct 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Quality partitions are constructed quickly by clustering multiple neighbor nodes with priority on nodes with high degree and repeating a few passes. Overhead is kept low by clustering multiple nodes in each pass and considering only edges between partitions. Our new computation reordering (Z-SORT) treats the values of index arrays as coordinates and reorders corresponding computations in Z-curve order. Applied to dense inputs, Z-SORT achieves performance close to data reordering combined with other computation reordering but without the overhead involved in data reordering.

This behavior can be abstracted by a partially synchronous computational model. In this setting, before reaching a period of synchrony, the underlying network can arbitrarily delay messages and these delays can be perceived as false failures by some timeout-based failure detection mechanism leading to unexpected service unavailability. This paper proposes a fully distributed solution for active software replication based on a three-tier software architecture well-suited to such a difficult setting. The formal correctness of the solution is proved by assuming the middle-tier runs in a partially synchronous distributed system. This architecture separates the ordering of the requests coming from clients, executed by the middle-tier, from their actual execution, done by replicas, i.e., the end-tier. In this way, clients can show up in any part of the distributed system and replica placement is simplified, since only the middle-tier has to be deployed on a well-behaving part of the distributed system that frequently respects synchrony bounds.

However, dropping the assumption that the monitored area is convex requires the application of greedy recovery strategies like traversing a locally extracted planar subgraph. This work investigates a recently proposed planar graph routing variant and introduces a slight but effective simplification. Both methods perform message forwarding along the edges of a virtual overlay graph instead of using wireless links for planar graph construction directly. In general, there exist connected network configurations where both routing variants may fail. However, we will prove three theoretical bounds which are a sufficient condition for guaranteed delivery of these routing strategies applied in specific classes of sensing covered networks. By simulation results, we show that geographical cluster-based routing outperforms existing related geographical routing variants based on one-hop neighbor information. Furthermore, simulations performed show that geographical cluster-based routing achieves a comparable performance compared to variants based on two-hop neighbor information, while maintaining the routing topology consumes a significantly reduced amount of communication resources"",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.124"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668056"",""Ad hoc networks";sensor networks;sensing coverage;geographic routing;"topology control."",""Routing";Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Ad hoc networks;Network topology;Mobile communication;Wireless communication;Sufficient conditions;Communication system control;"Spine"","""",""21"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

Active buffering can perform background I/O while the computation is going on, is extensible to remote I/O for more efficient data migration, and can be implemented in a portable style in today's parallel I/O libraries.

With an increase in the number of subscribers in the network, it becomes expedient to employ spectrum reusability techniques such as the use of multihop relaying in order to improve the capacity of the wireless systems. Throughput enhanced wireless in local loop (TWiLL) is one such architecture that employs multihop relaying and shortcut relaying to reuse bandwidth in WiLL systems. Compared to other multihop wireless network architectures, TWiLL architecture assumes significance due to its potential use in fixed wireless broadband services such as LMDS (local multipoint distribution service) and MMDS (multichannel multipoint distribution system). Analysis of the call acceptance ratio (CAR) in multihop wireless architectures including TWiLL is nontrivial as the Erlang B formula no longer holds. In this paper, we build multidimensional Markov chains to analyze the performance of multihop wireless systems such as TWiLL that has multiple types of channels. We also compare the results of our analysis with results from simulations. We observe that multihop relaying and shortcut relaying lead to a significant increase in the CAR of WiLL systems. Also, the free space propagation model that is normally used to model the radio channel is a very unrealistic model and does not consider reflection, diffraction, scattering, and multipath propagation that hinder transmissions in WiLL systems.

This mechanism introduces response loss when any one node or connection in the path fails, which is a common occurrence in the P2P system due to its dynamic feature. In this paper, we address the response loss problem and show that peers' oscillation can cause up to a 35 percent response loss in an unstructured P2P system.

We show that this greedy decision criterion has shortcomings in exploiting the file-sharing interaction among tasks since completion time values are inadequate to extract the global view of this interaction. We propose a three-phase scheduling approach which involves initial task assignment, refinement, and execution ordering phases. For the refinement phase, we model the target application as a hypergraph and, with an elegant hypergraph-partitioning-like formulation, we propose using iterative-improvement-based heuristics for refining the task assignments according to two novel objective functions. Unlike the turnaround time, which is the actual schedule cost, the smoothness of proposed objective functions enables the use of iterative-improvement-based heuristics successfully since their effectiveness and efficiency depend on the smoothness of the objective function.

This paper proposes to structure the P2P overlay topology using a heterogeneity-aware multitier topology to better balance the load at peers with heterogeneous capacities and to prevent low-capability nodes from throttling the performance of the system. An analytical model is developed to enable the construction and maintenance of heterogeneity-aware overlay topologies with good node connectivity and better load balance. We also develop an efficient routing scheme, called probabilistic selective routing, that further utilizes heterogeneity-awareness to enhance the routing performance. We evaluate our design through simulations. The results show that our multitier topologies alone can provide eight to 10 times improvement in the messaging cost, two to three orders of magnitude improvement in terms of load balancing, and seven to eight times lower topology construction and maintenance costs when compared to Gnutella's random power-law topology.

The media server partitions the job into several tasks and schedules them on the backend computing nodes for processing. For stream-based applications, the main design criteria of the scheduling are to minimize the total processing time and maintain the order of media units for each outgoing stream. In this paper, we first design, implement, and evaluate three scheduling algorithms, First Fit (FF), Stream-based Mapping (SM), and Adaptive Load Sharing (ALS), for multimedia transcoding in a cluster environment. We determined that it is necessary to predict the CPU load for each multimedia task and schedule them accordingly due to the variability of the individual jobs/tasks. We, therefore, propose an online prediction algorithm that can dynamically predict the processing time per individual task (media unit). We then propose two new load scheduling algorithms, namely, Prediction-based Least Load First (P-LLF) and Prediction-based Adaptive Partitioning (P-AP), which can use prediction to improve the performance. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of system throughput, out-of-order rate of outgoing media streams, and load balancing overhead through real measurements using a cluster of computers. The performance of the new load balancing algorithms is compared with all other load balancing schemes to show that P-AP greatly reduces the delay jitter and achieves high throughput for a variety of workloads in a heterogeneous cluster.

However, by reducing the number of links in the network, topology control algorithms actually decrease the degree of routing redundancy. As a result, the derived topology is more susceptible to node failures or departures. In this paper, we resolve this problem by enforcing k-vertex connectivity in the topology construction process. We propose a fully localized algorithm, fault-tolerant local spanning subgraph (FLSS), that can preserve k-vertex connectivity and is min-max optimal among all strictly localized algorithms (i.e., FLSS minimizes the maximum transmission power used in the network, among all strictly localized algorithms that preserve k-vertex connectivity). It can also be proved that FLSS outperforms two other existing localized algorithms in terms of reducing the transmission power. We also discuss how to relax several widely used assumptions in topology control to increase the practical utility of FLSS. Simulation results indicate that, compared with existing distributed/localized fault-tolerant topology control algorithms, FLSS not only has better power-efficiency, but also leads to higher network capacity. Moreover, FLSS is robust with respect to position estimation errors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.51"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603515"",""Algorithm design and analysis";fault tolerance;localized algorithms;topology control;"wireless ad hoc networks."",""Fault tolerance";Network topology;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Wireless sensor networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Energy efficiency;Algorithm design and analysis;Routing;"Estimation error"","""",""100"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""6 Mar 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

Our task is to schedule sensors to watch targets and pass data to the base station, such that the lifetime of the surveillance system is maximized, where the lifetime is the duration up to the time when there exists one target that cannot be watched by k sensors or data cannot be forwarded to the base station due to the depletion of energy of the sensor nodes. We propose an optimal solution to find the target watching schedule for sensors that achieves the maximal lifetime. Our solution consists of three steps: 1) computing the maximal lifetime of the surveillance system and a workload matrix by using linear programming techniques, 2) decomposing the workload matrix into a sequence of schedule matrices that can achieve the maximal lifetime, and 3) determining the sensor surveillance trees based on the above obtained schedule matrices, which specify the active sensors and the routes to pass sensed data to the base station.

Traditional traceback schemes provide spoofed packets traceback capability either by augmenting the packets with partial path information (i.e., packet marking) or by storing packet digests or signatures at intermediate routers (i.e., packet logging). Such approaches require either a large number of attack packets to be collected by the victim to infer the paths (packet marking) or a significant amount of resources to be reserved at intermediate routers (packet logging). We adopt a hybrid traceback approach in which packet marking and packet logging are integrated in a novel manner, so as to achieve the best of both worlds, that is, to achieve a small number of attack packets to conduct the traceback process and a small amount of resources to be allocated at intermediate routers for packet logging purposes. Based on this notion, two novel traceback schemes are presented. The first scheme, called distributed link-list traceback (DLLT), is based on the idea of preserving the marking information at intermediate routers in such a way that it can be collected using a link list-based approach. The second scheme, called probabilistic pipelined packet marking (PPPM), employs the concept of a """"pipeline"""" for propagating marking information from one marking router to another so that it eventually reaches the destination.

With an increase in the number of subscribers in the network, it becomes expedient to employ spectrum reusability techniques such as the use of multihop relaying in order to improve the capacity of the wireless systems. Throughput enhanced Wireless in Local Loop (TWiLL) is one such architecture that employs multihop relaying and shortcut relaying to reuse bandwidth in WiLL Systems. Compared to other multihop wireless network architectures, TWiLL architecture assumes significance due to its potential use in fixed wireless broadband services such as LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service) and MMDS (Multichannel Multipoint Distribution System). Analysis of the Call Acceptance Ratio (CAR) in multihop wireless architectures including TWiLL is nontrivial as the Erlang B formula no longer holds. In this paper, we build multidimensional Markov Chains to analyze the performance of multihop wireless systems such as TWiLL that has multiple types of channels. We also compare the results of our analysis with results from simulations. We observe that multihop relaying and shortcut relaying lead to a significant increase in the CAR of WiLL systems.

Each receiver is associated with a utility defined as a function of its streaming rate. Our goal is to maximize the aggregate utility of all receivers, subject to network capacity constraint and data constraint. The latter constraint is unique in overlay multicast, mainly due to the dual role of end hosts as both receivers and senders. We use a price-based approach to address this problem. Two types of prices, network price and data price, are generated with regard to the two constraints of the problem. A distributed algorithm is proposed, where each receiver adjusts its flow rate according to the associated network price and data price. The algorithm is proved to converge to the optimal point, where the aggregate utility of all receivers is maximized. We implement our algorithm using an end-host-based protocol.

The minimal transmission energy needed for correct reception by neighbor at distance r is proportional to r/sup /spl alpha//+c/sub e/, /spl alpha/ and c/sub e/ being two environment-dependent constants. We demonstrate the existence of an optimal transmission radius, computed with a hexagonal tiling of the network area, that minimizes the total power consumption for a broadcasting task. This theoretically computed value is experimentally confirmed. The existing localized protocols are inferior to existing centralized protocols for dense networks. We present two localized broadcasting protocols, based on derived """"target"""" radius, that remain competitive for all network densities. The first one, TR-LBOP, computes the minimal radius needed for connectivity and increases it up to the target one after having applied a neighbor elimination scheme on a reduced subset of direct neighbors. In the second one, TRDS, each node first considers only neighbors whose distance is no greater than the target radius (which depends on the power consumption model used), and neighbors in a localized connected topological structure such as RNG or LMST. Then, a connected dominating set is constructed using this subgraph. Nodes not selected for the set may be sent to sleep mode. Nodes in selected dominating set apply TR-LBOP. This protocol is the first one to consider both activity scheduling and minimum energy consumption as one combined problem.

Since the redistribution is performed at runtime, there is a performance tradeoff between the efficiency of the new data decomposition for a subsequent phase of an algorithm and the cost of redistributing data among processors. In this paper, we present a processor replacement scheme to minimize the cost of interprocessor data exchange during runtime. The main idea of the proposed technique is to develop a replacement function for reordering logical processors in the destination phase. Based on the replacement function, a realigned sequence of destination processors can be derived and is then used to perform data decomposition in the receiving phase. Together with local matrix and compressed CRS vectors transposition schemes, the interprocessor communication can be eliminated during runtime. A significant improvement of this approach is that the realignment of data can be performed without interprocessor communication for special cases. The second contribution of the present technique is that the complicated communication sets generation could be simplified by applying local matrix transposition. Consequently, the indexing cost could be reduced significantly. The proposed techniques can be applied in both dense and sparse applications. A generalized symmetric redistribution algorithm is also presented in this work. To analyze the efficiency of the proposed technique, the theoretical analysis proves that up to (p-1)/p data transmission cost can be saved. For general cases, the symmetric redistribution algorithm saves 1/p communication overheads compared with the traditional method. Experimental results also show that the proposed techniques provide superior performance in most data redistribution instances."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.162"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705461"",""Processor replacement";communication free;data redistribution;symmetric matrix;CRS transposition;"sparse matrix."",""Optimizing compilers";Symmetric matrices;Runtime;Costs;Computer Society;Sparse matrices;Parallel programming;Programming profession;Computer science;"Chaotic communication"","""",""3"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""2 Oct 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

Combining the horizontal expansion and vertical stacking of optical banyan networks is a general scheme for constructing banyan-based optical switching networks. The resulting horizontally expanded and vertically stacked optical banyan (HVOB) networks usually take either a high hardware cost or a large network depth to guarantee the nonblocking property. Blocking behavior analysis is an effective approach to studying network performance and finding a graceful compromise among hardware cost, network depth, and blocking probability";" however, little has been done to analyze the blocking behavior of general HVOB networks. In this paper, we study the overall blocking behavior of general HVOB networks, where an upper bound on the blocking probability of a HVOB network is developed with respect to the number of planes (stacked copies) and the number of stages. The upper bound accurately depicts the overall blocking behavior of a HVOB network as verified by an extensive simulation study, and it agrees with the strictly nonblocking condition of the network. The derived upper bound is significant because it reveals the inherent relationship among blocking probability, network depth, and network hardware cost, so that a desirable tradeoff can be made among them. In particular, our bound gives network developers an effective tool to estimate the maximum blocking probability of a HVOB network, in which different routing strategies can be applied with a guaranteed performance in terms of blocking probability, hardware cost and network depth. Our upper bound model predicts some unobvious qualitative behaviors of HVOB networks, and it draws an important conclusion that a very low blocking probability (e.g., less than 0.001 percent) can be achieved in a HVOB network without introducing either a significantly high hardware cost or a large network depth."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.126"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668067"",""Optical switching networks";banyan networks;blocking probability;horizontal expansion;"vertical stacking."",""Optical fiber networks";Hardware;Costs;Upper bound;Performance analysis;Optical switches;Optical losses;Stacking;Routing;"Predictive models"","""",""12"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

Such queries are often referred to as Online-analytical processing (OLAP). Typically, pages carrying query results do not exhibit temporal locality and, therefore, are not considered for caching at Internet proxies. In OLAP processing, this is a major problem as the cost of these queries is significantly larger than that of the transactional queries. This paper proposes a technique to reduce the response time for OLAP queries originating from geographically distributed private LANs and issued through the Web toward a central data warehouse (DW) of an enterprise. An active caching scheme is introduced that enables the LAN proxies to cache some parts of the data, together with the semantics of the DW, in order to process queries and construct the resulting pages. OLAP queries arriving at the proxy are either satisfied locally or from the DW, depending on the relative access costs.

These nodes are often energy-limited and also have limited buffer space. Therefore, efficient power saving mechanisms (e.g., sleeping mechanisms) are required so that the lifetime of these nodes can be extended while at the same time the quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g., packet delay and packet loss rate) for the relayed packets can be satisfied. In this paper, we present a novel queueing analytical framework to study the tradeoff between the energy saving and the QoS at a relay node. Specifically, by modeling the bursty traffic arrival process as a MAP (Markovian arrival process) and the packet service process as having a phase-type (PH) distribution, we model each node as a MAP/PH/1 nonpreemptive priority queue. The relayed packets and the node's own packets form two priority classes and the medium access control (MAC)/physical (PHY) layer protocol in the transmission protocol stack acts as the server process. Moreover, we use a phase-type vacation model for the energy-saving mechanism in a node when the MAC/PHY protocol refrains from transmitting in order to save battery power. Two different power saving mechanisms due to the standard exhaustive and the number-limited exhaustive vacation models (both in multiple vacation cases) are analyzed to study the tradeoff between the QoS performance of the relayed packets and the energy saving at a relay node. Also, an optimization formulation is presented to design an optimal wakeup strategy for the server process under QoS constraints. We use matrix-geometric method to obtain the stationary probability distribution for the system states from which the performance metrics are derived.

The intersession model aims to provide different levels of QoS to sessions from different customer classes, and the intrasession model aims to provide different levels of QoS to requests in different states of a session. A primary performance metric of online transactions is slowdown. It measures the waiting time of a request relative to its service time. We present a processing rate allocation scheme for 2D proportional slowdown differentiation. We then introduce service slowdown as a systemwide QoS metric of an e-commerce server. It is defined as the weighted sum of request slowdown in different sessions and in different session states. We formulate the problem of 2D service differentiation as an optimization of processing rate allocation with the objective of minimizing the service slowdown of the server.

"Routing table partitioning for speedy packet lookups in scalable routers,""M. . -F.

This work introduces and evaluates a technique for speedy packet lookups, called SPAL, in such routers. The BGP routing table under SPAL is fragmented into subsets which constitute forwarding tables for different FEs so that the number of table entries in each FE drops as the router grows. This reduction in the forwarding table size drastically lowers the amount of SRAM (e.g., L3 data cache) required in each LC to hold the trie constructed according to the prefix matching algorithm. SPAL calls for caching the lookup result of a given IP address at its home LC (denoted by LC/sub ho/, using the LR-cache), such that the result can satisfy the lookup requests for the same address from not only LC/sub ho/, but also other LCs quickly. Our trace-driven simulation reveals that SPAL leads to improved mean lookup performance by a factor of at least 2.5 (or 4.3) for a router with three (or 16) LCs, if the LR-cache contains 4K blocks. SPAL achieves this significant improvement, while greatly lowering the SRAM (i.e., the L3 data cache plus the LR-cache combined) requirement in each LC and possibly shortening the worst-case lookup time (thanks to fewer memory accesses during longest-prefix matching search) when compared with a current router without partitioning the routing table. It promises good scalability (with respect to routing table growth) and exhibits a small mean lookup time per packet. With its ability to speed up packet lookup performance while lowering overall SRAM substantially, SPAL is ideally applicable to the new generation of scalable high-performance routers."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.65"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613855"",""Caches";forwarding engines;interconnects;line cards;prefix matching search;routers;routing table lookups;"tries."",""Routing";Random access memory;Table lookup;Iron;Spine;Search engines;Internet;Fabrics;Switches;"Scalability"","""",""15"",""4"",""42"",""IEEE"",""3 Apr 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

This paper presents Sapphire, an experimental approach for systematic model generation for application adaptation within a target network. It employs a nearly-automated, statistical design of experiments to characterize the relationships of both application and network-level parameters. First, it applies the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method to identify the most significant parameters and their interactions that affect performance. Next, it generates a model of application performance with respect to these parameters within the ranges of measurements. The key benefit of the framework is the integration of several well-established concepts of statistical modeling and distributed systems in the form of simple APIs so that existing applications can take advantage of it. We demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of Sapphire by generating a performance model of an audio streaming application. We show that many existing multimedia and QoS-sensitive applications can exploit a statistical modeling approach such as Sapphire to incorporate application adaptivity.

The latter focuses on the file consistency problem on parallel machines with client-side file caching enabled.

A P2P lookup protocol routes a lookup request to its target node in a P2P distributed system. Existing protocols achieve balanced routing traffic among nodes by assuming that lookup requests are evenly targeted at every node. However, when lookup requests concentrate on a few nodes simultaneously, these nodes become hot spots. Due to uneven routing patterns in existing protocols, hot spots cause unbalanced routing traffic which leads to routing bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a novel structured P2P lookup protocol called SCALLOP that delivers balanced routing and avoids routing bottlenecks at occurrences of hot spots. Among existing protocols, SCALLOP is the first one to accomplish this goal at the fundamental nature of a routing protocol. SCALLOP achieves balanced routing by uniquely constructing a balanced lookup tree for each node. The balanced tree evenly distributes routing traffic among sibling nodes and, therefore, avoids or reduces routing bottlenecks. In addition, as a load-balanced protocol, SCALLOP delivers asymptotically optimal lookup performance at the tradeoff between routing path and routing table size. We conducted a set of simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of SCALLOP.

This paper investigates the inherent queuing delay introduced by the PPS's demultiplexing algorithm, responsible for dispatching cells to the middle-stage switches, relative to an optimal work-conserving switch. We first consider an N times N PPS without buffers in its input ports, operating at external rate R, internal rate r < R, and speedup (or overcapacity) S. We show that the inherent queuing delay of a symmetric and fault-tolerant PPS, where every demultiplexer may dispatch cells to all middle-stage switches, is Omega(N R/r) if no information is shared between the input ports. Sharing information between the input ports significantly reduces this lower bound, even if the information is outdated. These lower bounds indicate that employing algorithms using slightly out-of-date information may greatly improve the PPS performance. When the PPS has buffers in its input ports, an Omega(N/S) lower bound holds if the demultiplexing algorithm uses only local information or the input buffers are small relative to the time an input port needs to learn the switch global information"",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.129"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668068"",""Internetworking";ATM;"packet-switching networks."",""Delay";Packet switching;Switches;Demultiplexing;Asynchronous transfer mode;Aggregates;Distributed algorithms;Dispatching;"Fault tolerance"","""",""1"","""",""45"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper derives a lower bound on the number of and type of (single or multiwriter) variables that a mutual exclusion algorithm must use in order to be correct for PC-G. Specifically, any such solution for n processes must use at least one multiwriter variable and n single-writer variables. Peterson's algorithm for two processes uses one multiwriter and two single-writer variables, and therefore establishes that this bound is tight for two processes. This paper presents a new n-process algorithm for mutual exclusion that is correct for PC-G and achieves the bound for any n. While Peterson's algorithm is fair, this extension to arbitrary n is not fair. Six known algorithms that use the same number and type of variables are shown to fail to guarantee mutual exclusion when the memory consistency model is only PC-G, as opposed to the sequential consistency model for which they were designed.

Such protocols are very common in distributed computing to solve synchronization or coordination problems. Unfortunately, providing such a primitive is far from being trivial in asynchronous distributed systems prone to process crashes. (It is even impossible in fault-prone purely asynchronous systems.) To circumvent this difficulty, several protocols have been proposed that build a leader facility on top of an asynchronous distributed system enriched with additional assumptions. The protocols proposed so far consider either additional assumptions based on synchrony or additional assumptions on the pattern of the messages that are exchanged. Considering systems with n processes and up to f process crashes, 1lesf<n, this paper investigates the combination of a time-free assumption on the message pattern with a synchrony assumption on process speed and message delay. It shows that both types of assumptions can be combined to obtain a hybrid eventual leader protocol benefiting from the best of both worlds. This combined assumption considers a star communication structure involving f+1 processes. Its noteworthy feature lies in the level of combination of both types of assumption that is """"as fine as possible"""" in the sense that each of the f channels of the star has to satisfy a property independently of the property satisfied by each of the f-1 other channels (the f channels do not have to satisfy the same assumption). More precisely, this combined assumption is the following: There is a correct process p (center of the star) and a set Q of f processes q (pnotinQ) such that, eventually, either 1) each time it broadcasts a query, q receives a response from p among the (n-f) first responses to that query, or 2) the channel from p to q is timely. (The processes in the set Q can crash.) A surprisingly simple eventual leader protocol based on this fine grain hybrid assumption is proposed and proved correct.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, a new scheduling model was proposed that considers the contention for communication resources. Even though the accuracy and efficiency improved with the consideration of contention, the new contention model is still not good enough. The crucial aspect is the involvement of the processor in communication. This paper investigates the involvement of the processor in communication and its impact on task scheduling. A new system model is proposed based on the contention model that is aware of the processor involvement.

We describe and analyze a basic localized algorithm and three modifications for topology control that provide a tradeoff between performance and deployment cost. The objective is to regularize the topology for improved energy efficiency. The basic algorithm produces quasiregular networks, which only use nodes as sentries and relays that are approximately evenly spaced, thereby emulating a regular grid topology. It is shown that quasiregular networks have a significant energy and lifetime advantage compared with purely random networks. We consider two specific types of quasiregular networks: the ones that are based on a Gaussian deviation about an ideal grid point (type A), and the ones that consist of a subset of nodes taken from a Poisson point process (type B). We show that the two types are equivalent for a certain density of the Poisson point process and, in particular, that in both cases the deviation from the ideal regular grid follows a Rayleigh distribution, whereas the distance between nearest neighbors is Ricean"",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2006.130"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668062"",""Wireless sensor networks";wireless communications;network topology;network protocols;Poisson point processes;"Rayleigh fading."",""Network topology";Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system control;Algorithm design and analysis;Relays;Performance analysis;Costs;Nearest neighbor searches;"Wireless communication"","""",""18"","""",""12"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2006"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

Twins defines a logical multidimensional space for addressing and forwarding, while location service and management operations make use of a one-dimensional space. To improve scalability and performance, forwarding is hop-by-hop with greedy next-hop choice and the location service uses a rendezvous paradigm to distribute information among nodes.

In this paper, we study WDM optical interconnects that utilize low cost recirculating buffering and limited range wavelength conversion. We first consider the packet scheduling problem in this type of interconnect, and formalize the problem of maximizing throughput and minimizing packet delay as a matching problem in a bipartite graph. We give an optimal parallel algorithm for this problem that runs in O(Bk/sup 2/) time, compared to O((N+B)/sup 3/k/sup 3/) time if directly applied to existing matching algorithms for general bipartite graphs, where N is the number of input/output fibers of the interconnect, B is the number of fiber delay lines, and k is the number of wavelengths. We also consider efficient switching fabric designs for this type of interconnect.

As the number of program threads increases, the delay due to garbage collection also increases, thus restricting the scalability of the collector. In order to improve the scalability and reduce the pause time, an on-the-fly generational garbage collector called Yama is proposed for multiprocessor systems. This uses the on-the-fly deferred reference counting in the young generation and the DLG (Doligez Leroy Gonthier) on-the-fly mark and sweep garbage collector in the old generation. We have proposed and experimented with two novel variations of the on-the-fly deferred reference counting called Chitragupt1 and Chitragupt2 in the young generation. Yama does not pause all the application threads simultaneously. An adaptive tenuring policy based on object reference count and survival rate is also proposed. Yama has been implemented in the IBM Jikes RVM (research virtual machine). The above claims are supported with experimental results for standard benchmark programs.
