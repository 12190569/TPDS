"A cost model for selecting checkpoint positions in time warp parallel simulation,""F.

In this paper, we present a checkpointing technique in which the selection of the positions of checkpoints is based on a checkpointing-recovery cost model. Given the current state S, the model determines the convenience of recording S as a checkpoint before the next event is executed. This is done by taking into account the position of the last taken checkpoint, the granularity (i.e., the execution time) of intermediate events, and using an estimate of the probability that S will have to be restored due to rollback in the future of the execution. A synthetic benchmark in different configurations is used for evaluating and comparing this approach to classical periodic techniques. As a testing environment we used a cluster of PCs connected through a Myrinet switch coupled with a fast communication layer specifically designed to exploit the potential of this type of switch. The obtained results point out that our solution allows faster execution and, in some cases, exhibits the additional advantage that less memory is required for recording state vectors. This possibly contributes to further performance improvements when memory is a critical resource for the specific application. A performance study for the case of a cellular phone system simulation is finally reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution for a real world application."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.920586"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920586"","""",""Costs";Time warp simulation;Checkpointing;Discrete event simulation;Switches;Communication switching;Synchronization;History;Benchmark testing;"Personal communication networks"","""",""46"",""1"",""26"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

More recently, deadlock recovery strategies have begun to gain acceptance. In particular, progressive deadlock recovery techniques allocate a few dedicated resources to quickly deliver deadlocked packets. Deadlock recovery is based on the assumption that deadlocks are rare";" otherwise, recovery techniques are not efficient. Measurements of deadlock occurrence frequency show that deadlocks are highly unlikely when enough routing freedom is provided. However, networks are more prone to deadlocks when the network is close to or beyond saturation, causing some network performance degradation. Similar performance degradation behavior at saturation was also observed in networks using deadlock avoidance strategies. In this paper, we take a different approach to handling deadlocks and performance degradation. We propose the use of an injection limitation mechanism that prevents performance degradation near the saturation point and, at the same time, reduces the probability of deadlock to negligible values. We also propose an improved deadlock detection mechanism that uses only local information, detects all deadlocks, and considerably reduces the probability of false deadlock detection over previous proposals. In the rare case when impending deadlock is detected, our proposal consists of using a simple recovery technique that absorbs the deadlocked message at the current node and later reinjects it for continued routing toward its destination. Performance evaluation results show that our new approach to handling deadlock is more efficient than previously proposed techniques."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.940746"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940746"","""",""System recovery";Intelligent networks;Routing;Degradation;Resource management;Frequency measurement;Proposals;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Packet switching;"Workstations"","""",""15"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;

Since the redistribution is performed at runtime, there is a performance trade-off between the efficiency of the new data decomposition for a subsequent phase of an algorithm and the cost of redistributing data among processors. In this paper, we present a generalized processor mapping technique to minimize the amount of data exchange for BLOCK-CYCLIC(kr) to BLOCK-CYCLIC(r) array redistribution and vice versa. The main idea of the generalized processor mapping technique is first to develop mapping functions for computing a new rank of each destination processor. Based on the mapping functions, a new logical sequence of destination processors can be derived. The new logical processor sequence is then used to minimize the amount of data exchange in a redistribution. The generalized processor mapping technique can handle array redistribution with arbitrary source and destination processor sets and can be applied to multidimensional array redistribution. We present a theoretical model to analyze the performance improvement of the generalized processor mapping technique. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, we have implemented the generalized processor mapping technique on an IBM SP2 parallel machine.

Jobs arrive with mean rate /spl lambda/ and a general arrival distribution. Upon arrival, a job forks into K tasks. Task k, k=1, 2, ..., K, is assigned to the kth queuing system, which is a first-in-first-out server with a general service distribution and an infinite capacity queue.

High-speed LANs may change their topology due to switches being turned on/off, hot expansion, link remapping, and component failures. In these cases, a distributed reconfiguration protocol analyzes the topology, computes the new routing tables, and downloads them to the corresponding switches. Unfortunately, in most cases, user traffic is stopped during the reconfiguration process to avoid deadlock. These strategies are called static reconfiguration techniques. Although network reconfigurations are not frequent, static reconfiguration such as this may take hundreds of milliseconds to execute, thus degrading system availability significantly. Several distributed real-time applications have strict communication requirements";" Distributed multimedia applications have similar, although less strict, quality of service (QoS) requirements. Both stopping packet transmission and discarding packets due to the reconfiguration process prevent the system from satisfying the above requirements. Therefore, in order to support hard real-time and distributed multimedia applications over a high-speed LAN, we need to avoid stopping user traffic and discarding packets when the topology changes. In this paper, we propose a new deadlock-free distributed reconfiguration protocol that is able to asynchronously update routing tables without stopping user traffic. This protocol is valid for any topology, including regular as well as irregular topologies. It is also valid for packet switching as well as for cut-through switching techniques and does not rely on the existence of virtual channels to work.

Our proposal provides several novel features. The sender of each multicast may select among three increasingly strong delivery ordering guarantees: FIFO, causal, total. Movements do not trigger the transmission of any message in the wired network as no notion of hand-off is used. The set of senders and receivers (group) may be dynamic. The size of data structures at mobile hosts, the size of message headers, and the number of messages in the wired network for each multicast are all independent of the number of group members. The wireless network is assumed to provide only incomplete spatial coverage and message losses could occur even within cells.

This disconnection may occur because of different reasons: The clients may voluntarily switch off (to save battery power), or a client may be involuntarily disconnected due to its own movement in a mobile network (hand-off, wireless link failures, etc.). A mobile computing environment is characterized by slow wireless links and relatively underprivileged hosts with limited battery powers. Still, when data at the server changes, the client hosts must be made aware of this fact in order for them to invalidate their cache, otherwise the host would continue to answer queries with the cached values returning incorrect data. The nature of the physical medium coupled with the fact that disconnections from the network are very frequent in mobile computing environments demand a cache invalidation strategy with minimum possible overheads. In this paper, we present a new cache maintenance scheme, called AS. The objective of the proposed scheme is to minimize the overhead for the MHs to validate their cache upon reconnection, to allow stateless servers, and to minimize the bandwidth requirement. The general approach is (1) to use asynchronous invalidation messages and (2) to buffer invalidation messages from servers at the MH's Home Location Cache (HLC) while the MH is disconnected from the network and redeliver these invalidation messages to the MH when it gets reconnected to the network. Use of asynchronous invalidation messages minimizes access latency, buffering of invalidation messages minimizes the overhead of validating MH's cache after each disconnection and use of HLC off-loads the overhead of maintaining state of MH's cache from the servers. The MH can be disconnected from the server either voluntarily or involuntarily. We capture the effects of both by using a single parameter: The percentage of time a mobile host is disconnected from the network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme through simulation and performance modeling. In particular, we show that the average data access latency and the number of uplink requests by a MH decrease by using the proposed strategy at the cost of using buffer space at the HLC. We provide analytical comparison between our proposed scheme and the existing scheme for cache management in a mobile environment. Extensive experimental results are provided to compare the schemes in terms of performance metrics like latency, number of uplink requests, etc., under both a high and a low rate of change of data at servers for various values of the parameters. A mathematical model for the scheme is developed which matches closely with the simulation results."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.940744"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940744"","""",""Network servers";Delay;Switches;Batteries;Mobile computing;Power system management;Communication channels;Communication switching;Computer networks;"Physics computing"","""",""80"",""16"",""28"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

The removal of links, which is performed along a diagonal pruning direction, preserves the network's node-symmetry and diameter, while reducing its implementation complexity and VLSI layout area. In this paper, we prove that honeycomb and diamond networks are special subgraphs of complete 2D and 3D tori, respectively, and show this viewpoint to hold important implications for their physical layouts and routing schemes. Because pruning reduces the node degree without increasing the network diameter, the pruned networks have an advantage when the degree-diameter product is used as a figure of merit.

Furthermore, we offer a balanced rasterization of all transformed polygons. Experimental results prove these advantages on both a shared-memory SGI multiprocessor server and a Unix cluster of Sun workstations. We reveal performance effects of the new rendering scheme on subpixel resolution, polygon number, scene complexity, and memory requirements. The balanced parallel renderer demonstrates scalable performance with respect to increase in graphic complexity and in machine size. Our parallel renderer outperforms Crow's scheme in benchmark experiments performed. The improvements are made in three fronts: (1) reduction in rendering time, (2) higher efficiency with balanced workload,: and (3) adaptive to available buffer memory size. The balanced renderer can be more cost-effectively embedded within many 3D graphics algorithms, such as those for edge smoothing and 3D visualization.

The memory system provides parallel accesses to pq image points within a block(p/spl times/q), a horizontal (1/spl times/pq), a vertical (pq/spl times/1), a forward-diagonal, or a backward-diagonal subarray in a two-dimensional image array, M/spl times/N, where the design parameters p and q are all powers of two. In the address calculation and routing circuit of the proposed buffer memory system, the address differences of the five subarrays are prearranged according to the index numbers of memory modules and stored in two static random access memories (SRAMs), so that the address differences are simply added to the base address to obtain the addresses according to the index numbers of memory modules. In addition, for the fast address calculation, one single multiplication operation in the base address calculation is replaced by a SRAM access, so that the multiplication operation can be performed during the SRAM access for the address differences for the case when N is not a power of two.

In this paper, we reexamine the issue of designing cache invalidation strategies. We identify the basic issues in designing cache invalidation strategies. From the solutions to these issues, a large set of cache invalidation schemes can be constructed. We evaluate the performance of four representative algorithms-two of which are known algorithms (i.e., Dual-Report Cache Invalidation and Bit-Sequences) while the other two are their counterparts that exploit selective tuning (namely, Selective Dual-Report Cache Invalidation and Bit-Sequences with Bit Count).

Such a computing environment typically consists of processing nodes interconnected through a switch-based irregular network. Many of the problems that were solved for regular networks have to be solved anew for these systems. One such problem is that of efficient multicast communication. In this paper, we propose two broad categories of schemes for efficient multicasting in such irregular networks: network interface-based (NI-based) and switch-based. The NI-based multicasting schemes use the network interface of intermediate destinations for absorbing and retransmitting messages to other destinations in the multicast tree. In contrast, the switch-based multicasting schemes use hardware support for packet replication at the switches of the network and a concept known as multidestination routing to convey a multicast message from one source to multiple destinations. We first present alternative schemes for efficient multipacket forwarding at the NI and derive an optimal k-binomial multicast tree for multipacket NI-based multicast. We then propose two switch-based multicasting schemes that differ in the power of the encoding scheme and the complexity of the decoding logic at the switches. These multicasting schemes use path-based multidestination worms that can cover all nodes connected to switches along a valid unicast path and tree-based multidestination worms that can cover entire destination sets in a single phase using one worm, respectively. For each scheme, we describe the associated header encoding and decoding operation, the method for deriving multidestination worms that cover arbitrary multicast destination sets, and the multicasting scheme using the derived multidestination worms."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.926170"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926170"","""",""Communication switching";Switches;Computer networks;Packet switching;Encoding;Decoding;Parallel processing;Workstations;Concurrent computing;"Multicast communication"","""",""9"",""2"",""47"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;

The implementation model we present is an extension of the backtracking scheme developed by Hermenegildo and Nasr (1986) and relies on a novel memory organization scheme and on the use of various optimizations to reduce communication and overhead.

The speculative execution combined with the runtime dependence checking allows the parallelization of a variety of program constructs that cannot be parallelized with existing runtime parallelization algorithms. The pipelined execution of loop iterations in this new technique results in lower parallelization overhead than in other existing techniques. We evaluated the performance of this new model using some real applications and a synthetic benchmark. These experiments show that programs with a sufficiently large grain size compared to the parallelization overhead obtain significant speedup using this model. The results from the synthetic benchmark provide a means for estimating the performance that can be obtained from application programs that will be parallelized with this model.

This is in part due to difficulties in understanding the characteristics of a wide variety of I/O devices and in part due to inherent complexity of I/O software. While parallel I/O systems provide users with environments where persistent data sets can be shared between parallel processors, the ultimate performance of I/O-intensive codes depends largely on the relation between data access patterns exhibited by parallel processors and storage patterns of data in files and on disks. In cases where access patterns and storage patterns match, we can exploit parallel I/O hardware by allowing each processor to perform independent parallel I/O. In order to keep performance decent under circumstances in which data access patterns and storage patterns do not match, several I/O optimization techniques have been developed in recent years. Collective I/O is such an optimization technique that enables each processor to do I/O on behalf of other processors if doing so improves the overall performance. While it is generally accepted that collective I/O and its variants can bring impressive improvements as far as the I/O performance is concerned, it is difficult for the programmer to use collective I/O in an optimal manner. We propose and evaluate a compiler-directed collective I/O approach which detects the opportunities for collective I/O and inserts the necessary I/O calls in the code automatically. An important characteristic of the approach is that instead of applying collective I/O indiscriminately, it uses collective I/O selectively only in cases where independent parallel I/O would not be possible or would lead to an excessive number of I/O calls. The approach involves compiler-directed access pattern and storage pattern detection schemes that work on a multiple application environment. We have implemented the necessary algorithms in a source-to-source translator and within a stand-alone tool Our experimental results on an SGI/Cray Origin 2000 multiprocessor machine demonstrate that our compiler-directed collective I/O scheme performs very well on different setups built using nine applications from several scientific benchmarks. We have also observed that the I/O performance of our approach is only 5.23 percent worse than an optimal scheme."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.970566"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=970566"","""",""Programming profession";Parallel architectures;Pattern matching;Hardware;Cache storage;Software performance;File systems;Microprocessors;Network interfaces;"Random access memory"","""",""3"","""",""56"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

By extending the coterie join operation, we first propose a k-arbiter join operation to construct a new and larger k-arbiter from known k-arbiters for a large system. Then, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the k-arbiter join operation to construct a nondominated joined k-arbiter. Moreover, we discuss availability properties of the joined k-arbiters. We observe that, by selecting proper k-arbiters, the joined k-arbiter can provide a higher availability than that of the original input. Finally, we propose a k-arbiter compound, operation to construct k-arbiters by using coteries and/or k-coteries. By that way, the problem of constructing k-arbiters can be reduced to the problem of constructing coteries and/or k-coteries."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.969124"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969124"","""",""Bandwidth";Fault tolerance;Costs;Sufficient conditions;Fault tolerant systems;System recovery;"Safety"","""",""1"","""",""18"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We propose Global Access Control, an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language, the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation constraints. Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building compound state transition graphs for complex constraints.

A challenging task in such systems is servicing multiple clients simultaneously while satisfying real-time requirements of continuous delivery of objects at specified rates. To accomplish these tasks and realize economies of scale associated with servicing a large user population, a VOD server requires a large disk subsystem. Although a single disk is fairly reliable, a large disk farm can have an unacceptably high probability of disk failure. Furthermore, due to real-time constraints, the reliability requirements of VOD systems are even more stringent than those of traditional information systems. Traditional RAID solutions are inadequate due to poor resource usage. Thus, in this paper, we present alternative schemes which provide a high degree of reliability at low disk storage, bandwidth, and memory costs for on-demand multimedia servers. Moreover, we discuss some of the main issues and trade-offs associated with providing fault tolerance in multidisk VOD systems. We would like to impress upon the reader that one of the main points of this paper is the exposition of trade-offs and issues associated with designing fault-tolerant VOD servers.

This paper presents efficient multicasting with reduced link contention on irregular switch-based cut-through interconnection using the popular up*/down* (UD) routing and unicast message passing. First, it is proven that, for an arbitrary irregular network with UD routing, it is not possible to create an ordered list of nodes to implement an arbitrary multicast in a link contention-free manner with a minimal number of communication steps. Next, three different multicast algorithms are proposed with their respective node orderings to reduce link contention: switch-based ordering (SO), switch-based hierarchical ordering (SHO), and chain concatenation ordering (CCO). A variation of the binomial tree-based communication pattern, with unicast message passing, is used on the above orderings to implement multicast. Then, the problem of node contention is described in the case when multiple multicasts occur concurrently in a system. Using source-based information, the CCO algorithm is modified to propose a source-partitioned chain concatenation ordering (SPCCO) algorithm. It is also shown how the SPCCO algorithm reduces the effect of node contention at the cost of link contention. Using detailed simulation experiments, the proposed multicast algorithms are compared with each other as well as with the naive random ordering (RO) algorithm for a range of system sizes, switch sizes, message lengths, input buffer sizes, degrees of connectivity, destination set sizes, and communication start-up times. For the case of single multicast, the CCO algorithm is shown to be the best to implement multicast with reduced link contention and minimum latency, For the case of multiple multicasts, the SPCCO algorithm is shown to be the best when the start-up overhead dominates the propagation overhead and the CCO algorithm is shown to be the best otherwise. The results also highlight the importance of reducing link contention when designing efficient multicast, even for systems with large input buffers in the switches. Thus, these results demonstrate significant potential to be applied to current and future generation NOW systems with irregular interconnection."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.946654"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946654"","""",""Multicast algorithms";Communication switching;Switches;Routing;Unicast;Message passing;Workstations;High performance computing;Costs;"Delay"","""",""15"","""",""43"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

Since recharging batteries may not be possible while on mission, we are interested in designing protocols that are highly energy efficient. One of the most effective energy-saving strategies is to mandate that the stations go to sleep whenever they do not transmit or receive messages. It is well known that a station is expending power while its transceiver is active, that is, while transmitting or receiving a packet. It is perhaps surprising at first that a station is expending power even if it receives a packet that is not destined for it. Since, in single-hop radio networks, every station is within transmission range from every other station, the design of energy-efficient protocols is highly nontrivial. An instance of the permutation routing problem involves p stations of an RN, each storing n/p items. Each item has a unique destination which is the identity of the station to which the item must be routed. The goal is to route all the items to their destinations while expending as little energy as possible. Since, in the worst case, each item must be transmitted at least once, every permutation routing protocol must take n/k time slots. Similarly, each station must be awake for at least n/p time slots to transmit and/or receive packets. Our main contribution is to present an almost optimal energy-efficient permutation routing protocol for a k-channel, a p-station RN that routes n packets in at most (2d+2b+1)n/k+k time slots with no station being awake for more than (4d+7b-1)n/p time slots, where d=[(logp/k)/(logn/p)], b=[(log k)/(logn/p)] and k/spl les//spl radic/(p/2). Since, in most real-life situations, the number n of packets to route, the number p of stations in the RN, and the number k of channels available satisfy the relation k/spl Lt/p/spl Lt/n, it follows that d and b are very small."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.932709"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932709"","""",""Energy efficiency";Intelligent networks;Radio networks;Radio network;Batteries;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless application protocol;Telephony;"Robustness"","""",""25"","""",""49"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

We study the problem of maintaining k-edge/vertex connected components of a graph undergoing repeatedly dynamic updates, such as edge insertions and deletions, and answering the query of whether two vertices are included in the same k-edge/vertex connected component. Our major results are the following: (1) An NC algorithm for the 2-edge connectivity problem is proposed, which runs in O(log n log(m/n)) time using O(n/sup 3/4/) processors per update and query. (2) It is shown that the biconnectivity problem can be solved in O(log/sup 2 n/) time using O(n/spl alpha/(2n, n)/logn) processors per update and O(1) time with a single processor per query or in O(log n log/sub n///sup m/) time using O(n/spl alpha/(2n, n)/log n) processors per update and O(logn) time using O(n/spl alpha/(2n, n)/logn) processors per query, where /spl alpha/(.,.) is the inverse of Ackermann's function. (3) An NC algorithm for the triconnectivity problem is also derived, which takes O(log n log/sub n///sup m/+logn log log n//spl alpha/(3n, n)) time using O(n/spl alpha/(3n, n)/log n) processors per update and O(1) time with a single processor per query. (4) An NC algorithm for the 3-edge connectivity problem is obtained, which has the same time and processor complexities as the algorithm for the triconnectivity problem.

This paper presents a family of hybrid algorithms for wormhole-routed 2D meshes that can effectively utilize the complementary strengths of these two approaches to complete exchange. The performance of hybrid algorithms using Cyclic Exchange and Scott's Direct Exchange are studied using analytical models, simulation, and implementation on a Cray T3D system.

However, such workloads may not necessarily capture the behavior of real applications. In this paper, we have used parallel applications for a closer examination of the network behavior. In particular, the performance benefit from enhancing a 2D mesh with virtual channels (VCs) and a fully adaptive routing algorithm is examined with a set of shared-memory and message passing applications. Execution time and average message latency of shared memory applications are measured using execution-driven simulation and by varying many architectural attributes that affect the network workload. The communication traces of message passing applications, collected on an IBM-SP2, are used to run a trace-driven simulation of the mesh architecture to obtain message latency. Simulation results show that VCs and adaptive routing can reduce the network latency to varying degrees depending on the application. However, these modest benefits do not translate to significant improvements in the overall execution time because the load on the network is not high enough to exploit the advantages of the network enhancements. Moreover, this benefit may be negated if the architectural enhancements increase the network cycle time.

The issue becomes even more crucial and difficult as we gradually progress to the use of off-the-shelf workstations, operating systems, and high bandwidth networks to build cost-effective clusters for demanding applications. Clusters are gaining acceptance not just in scientific applications that need supercomputing power, but also in domains such as databases, web service, and multimedia which place diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) demands on the underlying system. Further, these applications have diverse characteristics in terms of their computation, communication, and I/O requirements, making conventional parallel scheduling solutions, such as space sharing or gang scheduling, unattractive. At the same time, leaving it to the native operating system of each node to make decisions independently can lead to ineffective use of system resources whenever there is communication. Instead, an emerging class of dynamic coscheduling mechanisms that attempt to take remedial actions to guide the system toward coscheduled execution without requiring explicit synchronization offers a lot of promise for cluster scheduling. Using a detailed simulator, this paper evaluates the pros and cons of different dynamic coscheduling alternatives while comparing their advantages over traditional gang scheduling (and not performing any coordinated scheduling at all). The impact of dynamic job arrivals, job characteristics, and different system parameters on these alternatives is evaluated in terms of several performance criteria. In addition, heuristics to enhance one of the alternatives even further are identified, classified, and evaluated. It is shown that these heuristics can significantly outperform the other alternatives over a spectrum of workload and system parameters and is thus a much better option for clusters than conventional gang scheduling."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.954632"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954632"","""",""Processor scheduling";Dynamic scheduling;Operating systems;Multimedia databases;Parallel machines;Workstations;Bandwidth;Web services;Multimedia systems;"Quality of service"","""",""33"",""8"",""41"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;

In distance, progress, and direction-based approaches'(reported in the literature), when node A wants to send or forward message m to destination node D, it forwards m to its neighbor C which is closest to D (has best progress toward D, whose direction is closest to the direction of D, respectively) among all neighbors of A. The same procedure is repeated until D, if possible, is eventually reached. The algorithms are referred to as GEDIR, MFR, and DIR when a common failure criterion is introduced: The algorithm stops if the best choice for the current node is the node from which the message came. We propose 2-hop GEDIR, DIR, and MFR methods in which node A selects the best candidate node C among its 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors according to the corresponding criterion and forwards m to its best 1-hop neighbor among joint neighbors of A and C. We then propose flooding GEDIR and MFR and hybrid single-path/flooding GEDIR and MFR methods which are the first localized algorithms (other than full flooding) to guarantee the message delivery (in a collision-free environment). We show that the directional routing methods are not loop-free, while the GEDIR and MFR-based methods are inherently loop free. The simulation experiments, with static random graphs, show that GEDIR and MFR have similar success rates, which is low for low degree graphs and high for high degree ones. When successful, their hop counts are near the performance of the shortest path algorithm. Hybrid single-path/flooding GEDIR and MFR methods have low communication overheads.

It describes how to avoid unnecessary data copies at both the sending and receiving sides for such an implementation. The resolution of problems arising from the mismatches between the requirements of the MPI standard and the features of LAPI is discussed. As a result of this exercise, certain enhancements to LAPI are identified to enable an efficient implementation of MPI on LAPI.

These new issues make traditional checkpointing algorithms unsuitable. Coordinated checkpointing is an attractive approach for transparently adding fault tolerance to distributed applications since it avoids domino effects and minimizes the stable storage requirement. However, it suffers from high overhead associated with the checkpointing process in mobile computing systems. Two approaches have been used to reduce the overhead: First is to minimize the number of synchronization messages and the number of checkpoints"; the other is to make the checkpointing process nonblocking. These two approaches were orthogonal previously until the Prakash-Singhal algorithm combined them. However, we found that this algorithm may result in an inconsistency in some situations and we proved that there does not exist a nonblocking algorithm which forces only a minimum number of processes to take their checkpoints. In this paper;" we introduce the concept of """"mutable checkpoint,"""" which is neither a tentative checkpoint nor a permanent checkpoint, to design efficient checkpointing algorithms for mobile computing systems. Mutable checkpoints can be saved anywhere, e.g., the main memory or local disk of MHs. In this way, taking a mutable checkpoint avoids the overhead of transferring large amounts of data to the stable storage at MSSs over the wireless network. We present techniques to minimize the number of mutable checkpoints. Simulation results show that the overhead of taking mutable checkpoints is negligible.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of a CORBA group communication service. Using CORBA to implement a group communication service enables that group communication service to operate in a heterogeneous, distributed computing environment. To evaluate the effect of CORBA on the performance of a group communication service, this paper provides a detailed comparison of the performance measured from three implementations of an atomic broadcast protocol and a group membership protocol. Two of these implementations use CORBA, while the third uses UDP sockets for interprocess communication. The main conclusion is that heterogeneity can be achieved in group communication services by implementing them using CORBA, but there is a substantial performance cost. This performance cost can be reduced to a certain extent by carefully choosing a design and tuning various protocol parameters such as buffer sizes and timer values."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.910873"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910873"","""",""Distributed computing";Protocols;Application software;Computer architecture;Atomic measurements;Costs;Delay;Broadcasting;Sockets;"Fault tolerance"","""",""17"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;

In order to examine the performance of our algorithms and to compare them to Time Warp, we made use of two of the largest digital logic circuits available from the ISCAS89 benchmark series of combinational circuits. The execution time, number of states saved, and maximal memory consumption were compared to the same quantities for time warp. Our results indicated that each of the algorithms occupies a different point in the spectrum of possible trade-offs between memory usage and execution time, ranging from substantial memory savings (at a comparable cost in speed) to memory savings and a comparable speed to time warp. Hence, an important benefit of our algorithms is the ability to trade off memory requirements with execution time."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.969122"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969122"","""",""Checkpointing";Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Discrete event simulation;Very large scale integration;Computer networks;Circuit simulation;Computer simulation;Application software;"Logic circuits"","""",""13"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

The multiple query problem (MQ, for short) is a 5-tuple (Q, A, D, /spl phi/, /spl oplus/), where Q is a set of queries, A is a set of items, D is a set of solutions, /spl phi/: Q/spl times/A/spl rarr/D is a function, and /spl oplus/ is a commutative and associative binary operator over D. The input to the MQ problem consists of a sequence Q=<q/sub 1/,q/sub 2/...,q/sub m/> of m queries from Q and of a sequence A=<a/sub 1/,a/sub 2/,...a/sub n/> of n items from A. The goal is to compute, for every query q/sub i/ (1/spl les/i/spl les/m) its solution defined as /spl phi/(q/sub i/,A)=/spl phi/(q/sub i/,a/sub 1/)/spl oplus//spl phi/(q/sub i/,a/sub 2/)/spl oplus//spl middot//spl middot//spl middot//spl oplus//spl phi/(q/sub i/,a/sub n/). We begin by discussing a generic algorithm that solves a large class of MQ problems in O(/spl radic/m+f(n)) time on a reconfigurable mesh of size /spl radic/n/spl times//spl radic/n, where f(n) is the time necessary to compute the expression d/sub 1/ /spl oplus/ d/sub 2/ /spl oplus//spl middot//spl middot//spl middot//spl oplus/ d/sub n/ with d/sub i/ /spl isin/ D on such a platform. We then go on to show that the MQ framework affords us an optimal algorithm for the multiple point location problem on a reconfigurable mesh of size /spl radic/n/spl times//spl radic/n. Given a set A of n points and a set Q of m (m/spl les/n) points in the plane, our algorithm reports, in O(/spl radic/m+log log n) time, all points of Q that lie inside the convex hull of A. Quite surprisingly, our algorithm solves the multiple point location problem without computing the convex hull of A which, in itself, takes /spl Omega/(/spl radic/n) time on a reconfigurable mesh of size /spl radic/n/spl times//spl radic/n. Finally, we prove an /spl Omega/(/spl radic/m+g(n)) time lower bound for nontrivial MQ problems, where g(n) is the lower bound for evaluating the expression d/sub 1/ /spl oplus/ d/sub 2/ /spl oplus//spl middot//spl middot//spl middot//spl oplus/ d/sub n/ with d/sub i/ /spl isin/ D, on a reconfigurable mesh of size /spl radic/n/spl times//spl radic/n."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.954618"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954618"","""",""Computer Society";Pattern recognition;Image databases;Image processing;Application software;Spatial databases;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational geometry;Computer vision;"Navigation"","""",""2"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;

In this paper, we look into the issue of realizing an all-to-all personalized exchange in a class of optical multistage networks. Advances in electrooptic technologies have made optical communication a promising networking choice to meet the increasing demands for high channel bandwidth and low communication latency of high-performance computing/communication applications. Although optical multistage networks hold great promise and have demonstrated advantages over their electronic counterpart, they also hold their own challenges. Due to the unique properties of optics, crosstalk in optical switches should be avoided to make them work properly. In this paper, we provide a systematic scheme for realizing an all-to-all personalized exchange in a class of unique-path optical multistage networks crosstalk-free. The basic idea of realizing an all-to-all personalized exchange in such a multistage network is to transform it to multiple semipermutations and ensure that each of them can be realized crosstalk-free in a single pass. As can be seen, the all-to-all personalized exchange algorithm we propose has O(n) time complexity for n processors, which is optimal for an all-to-all personalized exchange. The optimal time complexity combined with the property of a single input/output port per processor suggests that a multistage network could be a better choice for implementing an all-to-all personalized exchange due to its shorter communication latency and better scalability."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.932711"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932711"","""",""Optical crosstalk";Optical fiber networks;Delay;Parallel processing;Optical fiber communication;Bandwidth;Computer applications;Computer networks;Optical computing;"Optical switches"","""",""28"","""",""21"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

In this compiler approach, processors are logically reordered according to the given communication(s) so that the new communication(s) can be efficiently realized on the hypercube network.

Traditional dynamic load balancers are mostly inadequate because they lack a global view of system loads across processors. In this paper, we propose a novel and general-purpose load balancer that utilizes symmetric broadcast networks (SBN) as the underlying communication topology and compare its performance with a successful global load balancing environment, called PLUM, specifically created to handle adaptive unstructured applications.

This enables us to model certain sequential loops as a sequence of SIR equations. A parallel algorithm that solves a set of SIR equations will, in fact, parallelize sequential loops of the above type. Such a parallel SIR algorithm must be efficient enough to compete with the O(n) work complexity of the original loop. We show why efficient parallel algorithms for the related problems of list ranking and tree contraction, which require O(n) work, cannot be applied to solving SIR. We instead use repeated iterations of pointer jumping to compute the final values of X[] in n/p/spl middot/log p steps and n/spl middot/log p work, with p processors. A sequence of experiments was performed to test the effect of synchronous and asynchronous executions on the actual performance of the algorithm. These experiments show that pointer jumping requires O(n)) work in most practical cases of SIR loops.

Nodes in the ring work asynchronously and proceed in a cyclic sequence of K phases, where K is even. The phase values of all the nodes are required to be no more than one apart. A system state which satisfies the requirement is therefore called a legitimate state. The proposed protocol guarantees that no matter with which initial state the system may start, the ring stabilizes eventually at a state after which the closure property on the legitimate state holds. Phase values should never go backward. The closure property on the legitimate states commonly used in previous works on self-stabilization cannot capture this requirement. This paper defines two terms, legitimate step and illegitimate step, to address this issue. An execution step that brings the ring from a legitimate state to another legitimate state in a way that the phase values of the nodes only advance is called a legitimate step. An execution step that observes the closure property on the legitimate states but makes some phase values go backward is modeled as an illegitimate step. It is shown that, for the proposed protocol, only a finite number of illegitimate steps are possible.

Delay-guaranteed communication is achieved with a modified version of Traffic-Controlled Rate-Monotonic Priority Scheduling (TCRM). A set of statistical real-time channels that share similar traffic characteristics are multiplexed into a common macrochannel. Those statistical real-time channels which are multiplexed together share the resources of a macrochannel, and individual statistical real-time channels are given timeliness and probabilistic cell-loss guarantees. A macrochannel is serviced by the modified TCRM which improves link utilization and makes channel management simpler. Based on the analysis of an M/D/1/N queueing system, we propose a procedure for determining the transmission capacity of a macrochannel necessary to statistically guarantee a cell-loss ratio bound.

The MIT Raw microprocessor is a proposed architecture that strives to exploit these chip-level resources by implementing thousands of tiles, each comprising a processing element and a small amount of memory, coupled by a static two-dimensional interconnect. A compiler partitions fine-grain instruction-level parallelism across the tiles and statically schedules intertile communication over the interconnect. Because Raw microprocessors fully expose their internal hardware structure to the software, they can be viewed as a gigantic FPGA with coarse-grained tiles in which software orchestrates communication over static interconnections. One open challenge in Raw architectures is to determine their optimal grain size and balance. The grain size is the area of each tile and the balance is the proportion of area in each tile devoted to memory, processing, communication, and off-chip global I/O. If the total chip area is fixed, higher processing power per tile requires large tiles and hence reduces the total number of tiles on the chip. This paper presents SimpleFit, a novel analytical framework that designers can use to reason about the design space of Raw microprocessors. Our model is also generalizable to multiprocessors on a chip. Based on an architectural model, an application model, and a VLSI cost analysis, the framework computes the performance of applications and uses an optimization process to identify designs that will execute these applications most cost-effectively, Although the optimal machine configurations obtained vary for different applications, problem sizes, and budgets, the general trends for various applications are similar. Accordingly, for the applications studied, assuming a one billion logic transistor equivalent area, we recommend building a Raw chip with approximately 1,000 tiles, 30 words/cycle global I/O, 20 Kbytes of local memory per tile, three to four words/cycle local communication bandwidth, and single-issue processors. This configuration will give performance near the global optimum for most applications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.940747"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940747"","""",""Microprocessors";Very large scale integration;Grain size;Electronics industry;Transistors;Parallel processing;Job shop scheduling;Processor scheduling;"Hardware"","""",""12"",""16"",""29"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Furthermore, multiple speculative stores to a memory location create multiple speculative versions of the location. Program order among the speculative versions must be tracked to maintain sequential semantics. A previously proposed approach, the Address Resolution Buffer (ARB) uses a centralized buffer to support speculative versions.

Compiler optimizations aimed at improving cache locality are critical in realizing the performance potential of powerful processors. For scientific applications, several loop transformations have been shown to be useful in improving both temporal and spatial locality. Recently, there has been some work in the area of data layout optimizations, i.e., changing the memory layouts of multidimensional arrays from the language-defined default such as column-major storage in Fortran. The effect of such memory layout decisions is on the spatial locality characteristics of loop nests. While data layout transformations are not constrained by data dependences, they have no effect on temporal locality. On the other hand, loop transformations are not readily applicable to imperfect loop nests and are constrained by data dependences. More importantly, loop transformations affect the memory access patterns of all the arrays accessed in a loop nest and, as a result, the locality characteristics of some of the arrays may worsen. This paper presents a technique based on integer linear programming (ILP) that attempts to derive the best combination of loop and data layout transformations. Prior attempts to unify loop and data layout transformations for programs consisting of a sequence of loop nests have been based on heuristics not only for transformations for a single loop nest but also for the sequence in which loop nests will be considered. The ILP formulation presented here obviates the need for such heuristics and gives us a bar against which the heuristic algorithms can be compared. More importantly, our approach is able to transform memory layouts dynamically during program execution. This is particularly useful in applications whose disjoint code segments demand different layouts for a given array. In addition, we show how this formulation can be extended to address the false sharing problem in a multiprocessor environment. The key data structure we introduce is the memory layout graph (MLG) that allows us to formulate the problems as path problems. The paper discusses the relationship of this ILP approach based on the memory layout graphs to other work in the area including our previous work. Experimental results on a MIPS R10000-based system demonstrate the benefits of this approach and show that the use of the ILP formulation does not increase the compilation time significantly."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2001.1184186"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184186"","""",""Dynamic programming";Integer linear programming;Optimizing compilers;Random access memory;Program processors;Application software;Multidimensional systems;Heuristic algorithms;Data structures;"Helium"","""",""9"",""1"",""61"",""IEEE"",""6 Feb 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;

In this paper we present our results of using symbolic model checking to verify distributed algorithms against the self-stabilizing property. In general, the most difficult problem with model checking is state explosion";" it is especially serious in verifying the self-stabilizing property, since it requires the examination of all possible initial states. So far applying model checking to self-stabilizing algorithms has not been successful due to the problem of state explosion. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose to use symbolic model checking for this purpose. Symbolic model checking is a verification method which uses Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) to compactly represent state spaces. Unlike other model checking techniques, this method has the advantage that most of its computations do not depend on the initial states. We show how to verify the correctness of algorithms by means of SMV, a well-known symbolic model checker. By applying the proposed approach to several algorithms in the literature, we demonstrate empirically that the state spaces of self-stabilizing algorithms can be represented by OBDDs very efficiently. Through these case studies, we also demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach in detecting errors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.899941"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899941"","""",""Distributed algorithms";State-space methods;Explosions;Data structures;Boolean functions;Computer science;Application software;Centralized control;Routing;"Mathematical model"","""",""18"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;

A user may desire to know such a state to tell whether the mobile distributed system is still running or is silent because some processes are disconnected.

These sets arise due to the mapping of arrays onto processors. In this paper, we focus on how ownership sets can be efficiently determined in the context of the HPF language and show how the structure of these sets can be symbolically characterized in the presence of arbitrary array alignment and array distribution directives. Our starting point is a system of equalities and inequalities due to Ancourt et al. (1995) that captures the array mapping problem in HPF. We arrive at a refined system that enables us to efficiently solve for the ownership set using the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination technique and that requires the course vector as the only auxiliary vector. The formulation makes it possible to enumerate the elements of the ownership set exactly once, a feature that is very beneficial when such sets are applied to handle DO loops qualified by HPF's INDEPENDENT directive. We develop important and general properties pertaining to HPF alignments and distributions and show how they can be used to eliminate redundant communication due to array replication. Polynomial-time schemes that determine whether the ownership set of a particular processor, with respect to some array, is the empty set or whether the ownership set of every processor, with respect to some array, is the empty set, are presented. We show how distribution directives with unspecified processor meshes can be efficiently handled at compile time. We also show how to avoid the generation of communication code when pairs of array references are ultimately mapped onto the same processors.

Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol and the service time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean 1. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves and in particular we are interested in the effect that the parameter d has on the expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. Our approach uses a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n/spl rarr//spl infin/ to approximate the behavior of finite systems. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own right. Along with a theoretical justification of this approach, we provide simulations that demonstrate that the method accurately predicts system behavior, even for relatively small systems. Our analysis provides surprising implications.

The algorithm follows the INSPECTOR/EXECUTOR scheme and exploits parallelism at a fine-grained memory reference level. It features a parallel inspector and improves upon previous algorithms of the same generality by exploiting parallelism among consecutive reads of the same memory element. Two variants of the algorithm are considered: One allows partially concurrent reads (PCR) and the other allows fully concurrent reads (FCR). Analyses of their time complexities derive a necessary condition with respect to the iteration workload for runtime parallelization. Experimental results for a Gaussian elimination loop, as well as an extensive set of synthetic loops on a 12-way SMP server, show that the time stamp algorithms outperform iteration-level parallelization techniques in most test cases and gain speedups over sequential execution for loops that have heavy iteration workloads. The PCR algorithm performs best because it makes a better trade-off between maximizing the parallelism and minimizing the analysis overhead. For loops with light or unknown iteration loads, an alternative speculative runtime parallelization technique is preferred."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.926166"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926166"","""",""Runtime";Parallel processing;Computational fluid dynamics;Fluid dynamics;Sparse matrices;Computer Society;Sequential analysis;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;"Computational modeling"","""",""14"","""",""40"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

Allocating such partitions in the order in which the jobs arrive (FCFS scheduling) is fair and predictable, but suffers from severe fragmentation, leading to low utilization. This situation led to the development of the EASY scheduler which uses aggressive backfilling: Small jobs are moved ahead to fill in holes in the schedule, provided they do not delay the first job in the queue. We compare this approach with a more conservative approach in which small jobs move ahead only if they do not delay any job in the queue and show that the relative performance of the two schemes depends on the workload. For workloads typical on SP2 systems, the aggressive approach is indeed better, but, for other workloads, both algorithms are similar. In addition, we study the sensitivity of backfilling to the accuracy of the runtime estimates provided by the users and find a very surprising result. Backfilling actually works better when users overestimate the runtime by a substantial factor."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.932708"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932708"","""",""Runtime";Processor scheduling;Delay;Supercomputers;Measurement;Helium;Dynamic scheduling;Production;"Laboratories"","""",""468"",""7"",""27"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

This requirement becomes especially important in the case of long messages. The only type of protocols able to guarantee waiting free routing under heavy load are algorithms based on deflection (also called nonminimal adaptive or hot potato) routing. This paper deals with problems connected with the use of deflection algorithms. In contrast to the case of nonadaptive or partially (e.g., minimal) adaptive routing, it is very infrequent that an unrestricted deflection routing becomes deadlocked and, similarly, livelock is not a serious problem. On the other hand, there is another phenomenon, called a deflection jam, that limits throughput of deflection algorithms used to route long messages. It has been observed for many deflection heuristics, interconnection network topologies, and both virtual cut-through and wormhole routing. A deflection jam is a sudden and persistent saturation of a network which sometimes occur, after a very long period of undisturbed communication.

We present two new multilevel algorithms for repartitioning adaptive meshes that improve the performance of multilevel schemes for the types of problems that current schemes perform poorly while maintaining similar or better results for those problems that current schemes perform well. Specifically, we present a new scratch-remap scheme called Locally-matched Multilevel Scratch-remap (or simply LMSR) for repartitioning of adaptive meshes. LMSR tries to compute a high-quality partitioning that has a large amount of overlap with the original partitioning. We show that LMSR generally decreases the data redistribution costs required to balance the load compared to current scratch-remap schemes. We present a new diffusion-based scheme that we refer to as Wavefront Diffusion. In Wavefront Diffusion, the flow of vertices moves in a wavefront from overweight to underweight subdomains. We show that Wavefront Diffusion obtains significantly lower data redistribution costs while maintaining similar or better edge-cut results compared to existing diffusion algorithms. We also compare Wavefront Diffusion with LMSR and show that these provide a trade-off between edge-cut and data redistribution costs for a wide range of problems. Our experimental results on a Gray T3E, an IBM SP2, and a cluster of Pentium Pro workstations show that both schemes are fast and scalable. For example, both are capable of repartitioning a seven million vertex graph in under three seconds on 128 processors of a Gray T3E.
