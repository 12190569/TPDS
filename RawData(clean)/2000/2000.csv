This proposed class of networks combines the use of tunable Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL's), Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and a scalable, hierarchical network architecture to implement large-scale optical crossbar based networks. A free-space and optical waveguide-based crossbar interconnect utilizing tunable VCSEL arrays is proposed for interconnecting processor elements within a local cluster. A similar WDM optical crossbar using optical fibers is proposed for implementing intercluster crossbar links. The combination of the two technologies produces large-scale optical fan-out switches that could be used to implement relatively low cost, large scale, high bandwidth, low latency, fully connected crossbar clusters supporting up to hundreds of processors. An extension of the crossbar network architecture is also proposed that implements a hybrid network architecture that is much more scalable. This could be used to connect thousands of processors in a multiprocessor configuration while maintaining a low latency and high bandwidth. Such an architecture could be very suitable for constructing relatively inexpensive, highly scalable, high bandwidth, and fault-tolerant interconnects for large-scale, massively parallel computer systems. This paper presents a thorough analysis of two example topologies, including a comparison of the two topologies to other popular networks. In addition, an overview of a proposed optical implementation and power budget is presented, along with analysis of proposed media access control protocols and corresponding optical implementation."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.852398"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852398"","""",""Optical interconnections";Stimulated emission;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Wavelength division multiplexing;Bandwidth;Optical fiber networks;Tunable circuits and devices;"Optical waveguides"","""",""27"",""3"",""38"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we present a generalized basic-cycle calculation (GBCC) method to efficiently perform a BLOCK-CYCLIC(s) over P processors to BLOCK-CYCLIC(t) over Q processors array redistribution. In the GBCC method, a processor first computes the source/destination processor/data sets of array elements in the first generalized basic-cycle of the local array it owns. A generalized basic-cycle is defined as lcm(sP, tQ)/(gcd(s,t)/spl times/P) in the source distribution and lcm(sP, tQ)/(gcd(s,t)/spl times/Q) in the destination distribution. From the source/destination processor/data sets of array elements in the first generalized basic-cycle, we can construct packing/unpacking pattern tables to minimize the data-movement operations. Since each generalized basic-cycle has the same communication pattern, based on the packing/unpacking pattern tables, a processor can pack/unpack array elements efficiently. To evaluate the performance of the GBCC method, we have implemented this method on an IBM SP2 parallel machine, along with the PITFALLS method and the ScaLAPACK method. The cost models for these three methods are also presented. The experimental results show that the GBCC method outperforms the PITFALLS method and the ScaLAPACK method for all test samples.

In a military situation, the data staging problem involves positioning data for facilitating a faster access time when it is needed by programs that will aid in decision making. This work concentrates on solving a basic version of the data staging problem in which all parameter values for the communication system and the data request information represent the best known information collected so far and stay fixed throughout the scheduling process. The network is assumed to be oversubscribed and not all requests for data items can be satisfied. A mathematical model for the basic data staging problem is introduced. Then, three multiple-source shortest-path algorithm-based heuristics for finding a near-optimal schedule of the communication steps for staging the data are presented. Each heuristic can be used with each of four cost criteria developed. Thus, 12 implementations are examined. In addition, two different weightings for the relative importance of different priority levels are considered. The performance of the proposed heuristics are evaluated and compared by simulations. The proposed heuristics are shown to perform well with respect to upper and lower bounds.

These possible dependencies among messages create problems if we need n players to announce independently chosen values. This task is called simultaneous broadcast. In this paper, we present the first constant round protocol for simultaneous broadcast in a reasonable computation model (which includes a common shared random string among the players).

It is composed of two subprotocols: the routing table establishment subprotocol and the packet forwarding subprotocol. In the routing table establishment subprotocol, we propose four methods (SSP, MIN-D, SET, and GET) for enforcing an order among routers for the purpose of loop prevention. These methods differ from each other on information used to maintain orders, the impact on QoS, and the compatibility to the existing routing protocols. In the packet forwarding subprotocol, we propose a Weighted-Random Selection (WRS) approach for multiple path selection in order to balance network traffic. In particular, the fixed and adaptive methods are proposed to determine the weights. Both of them explicitly take into account the characteristics of distribution of anycast recipient group while the adaptive method uses the dynamic information of the anycast traffic as well. Correctness property of the protocol is formally proven. Extensive simulation is performed to evaluate our newly designed protocol. Performance data shows that the loop-prevention methods and the WRS approaches have great impact on the performance in terms of average end-to-end packet delay.

We present algorithms that consider both iteration space (loop) and data space (file layout) transformations in a unified framework. We show that the performance of an out-of-core loop nest containing references to out-of-core arrays can be improved by using a suitable combination of file layout choices and loop restructuring transformations. Our approach considers array references one-by-one and attempts to optimize each reference for parallelism and locality. When there are references for which parallelism optimizations do not work, communication is vectorized so that data transfer can be performed before the innermost loop. Results from hand-compiles on IBM SP-2 and Inter Paragon distributed-memory message-passing architectures show that this approach reduces the execution times and improves the overall speedups.

This is particularly important for those applications with dynamic memory access patterns. We propose a memory-layout oriented technique to exploit cache locality of parallel loops at runtime on Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems. Guided by application-dependent and targeted architecture-dependent hints, our system, called Cacheminer, reorganizes and partitions a parallel loop using the memory-access space of its execution. Through effective runtime transformations, our system maximizes the data reuse in each partitioned data region assigned in a cache, and minimizes the data sharing among the partitioned data regions assigned to all caches. The executions of tasks in the partitions are scheduled in an adaptive and locality-presented way to minimize the execution time of programs by trading off load balance and locality. We have implemented the Cacheminer runtime library on two commercial SMP servers and an SimCS simulated SMP. Our simulation and measurement results show that our runtime approach can achieve comparable performance with the compiler optimizations for programs with regular computation and memory-access patterns, whose load balance and cache locality can be well optimized by the tiling and other program transformations. However, our experimental results show that our approach is able to significantly improve the memory performance for the applications with irregular computation and dynamic memory access patterns. These types of programs are usually hard to optimize by static compiler optimizations."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.850833"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850833"","""",""Runtime";Optimizing compilers;Program processors;Application software;Computational modeling;Parallel processing;Network servers;Hardware;Computer Society;"Adaptive scheduling"","""",""11"",""5"",""26"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Then, the iteration space is divided into discrete groups of related iterations, which are assigned to different processors, while preserving the optimal completion time. Chain Grouping is based on clustering together neighboring uniform chains of iterations, formed by a particular dependence vector. This vector will be proven as the best among all to reduce the total communication requirements.

Both unicast and path-based implementations of multicasting incur communication costs due to the inherent message passing and contention for network resources. The start-up time dominates the transmission time when the data volume is small. However, in the presence of multiple multicasts when the data volume is very large, the communication delays due to message blocking and resource contention become very significant. Because of this, we present a hybrid static-dynamic technique to reduce the communication costs incurred when performing multiple multicasts on wormhole routed direct networks. This technique requires a focus on ordering and routing information for the individual message transmissions. At compile time, each message is assigned a priority using the recently developed collision graph model. Then at runtime these priorities are used to arbitrate the message transmissions. As a base, dimension-ordered routing is used. However, to further reduce the communication costs, some messages will be rerouted. This technique is useful either as a stand-alone algorithm or as an embedded procedure into existing algorithms. Furthermore, the techniques can be applied to higher dimension direct networks. For a single multicast, our work performs as well as conventional methods. For multiple multicasts, results show that our approach provides significant improvement over baseline techniques."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.879771"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879771"","""",""Costs";Routing;Unicast;Runtime;Multicast algorithms;Hardware;Multiprocessing systems;Message passing;Delay;"Communication switching"","""",""1"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

While the stale reference detection finds the memory reference patterns that may violate cache coherence, the locality preserving analysis minimizes the number of such stale references by analyzing both temporal and spatial reuses. By computing the regions referenced by arrays inside loops, we extend the previous scalar algorithms for more precise analysis. We develop a full interprocedural array data-flow algorithm, which performs both bottom-up side-effect analysis and top-down context analysis on the procedure call graph to further exploit locality across procedure boundaries. The interprocedural algorithm eliminates cache invalidations at procedure boundaries, which were assumed in the previous compiler algorithms. We have fully implemented the algorithm in the Polaris parallelizing compiler. Using execution-driven simulations on Perfect Club benchmarks, we demonstrate how unnecessary cache misses can be eliminated by the automatic stale reference detection.

In particular, we extend a well-known parallelization technique called run-time compilation to use structure information that is explicit on the array subscripts. This paper presents a number of internal representations suited to particular access patterns and shows how various preprocessing structures such as translation tables, trace arrays, and interprocessor communication schedules can be encoded in terms of one or more of these representations. We show how loop and index normalization are important for detection of irregularity in array references, as well as the presence of locality in such references. This paper presents methods for detection of irregularity, feasibility of inspection, and finally, placement of inspectors and interprocessor communication schedules. We show that this process can be automated through extensions to an HPF/Fortran-77 distributed-memory compiler (PARADIGM) and a new runtime support for irregular problems (PILAR) that uses a variety of internal representations of communication patterns. We devise performance measures which consider the relationship between the inspection cost, the execution cost, and the number of times the executor is invoked so that a comparison of the competing schemes can be performed independent of the number of iterations. Finally, we show experimental results on an IBM SP-2 that validate our approach.

In these systems, a set of entities (communication equipment or processors) communicate through the switching network by exchanging messages. Simultaneous transmission or reception of two 01 more different messages through an input or output port results in the corruption of the messages (also called collision), which are useless and must be retransmitted later. This causes a performance degradation. Collisions can be avoided only by a proper scheduling of the messages. The same problem also arises in single-hop purely optical WDM systems, where simultaneous reception or transmission over the same wavelength channel results in a collision. In this paper, we study the problem of minimum length scheduling of a set of messages subject to precedence constraints. We show that the decision version of the problem is NP-complete even in very restricted cases. This means that the optimization problem cannot be solved in polynomial time, unless P=NP. Since the problem cannot be optimally solved by fast algorithms, we then investigate the existence of polynomial time approximation algorithms, by first proving that approximation algorithms cannot exist with performance ratio bounded by 4/3 or smaller and successively presenting an /spl epsiv/-approximation algorithm with /spl epsiv/<2 for the case of two precedence classes of messages.

Each entry must be filled with an appropriate value provided by the corresponding process. Several distributed computing problems amount to compute a function on a global data. This paper proposes a protocol to solve such problems in the context of asynchronous distributed systems where processes may fail by crashing. The main problem that has to be solved lies in computing the global data and in providing each noncrashed process with a copy of it, despite the possible crash of some processes. To be consistent, the global data must contain, at least, all the values provided by the processes that do not crash. This defines the Global Data Computation (GDC) problem. To solve this problem, processes execute a sequence of asynchronous rounds during which they construct, in a decentralized way, the value of the global data and eventually each process gets a copy of it. To cope with process crashes, the protocol uses a perfect failure detector. The proposed protocol has been designed to be time efficient: it allows early decision. Let t be the maximum number of processes that may crash, t<n where n is the total number of processes, and f be the actual number of process crashes (f/spl les/t). In the worst case, the protocol terminates in min(2f+2,t+1) rounds. Moreover, the protocol does not require processes to exchange information on their perception of crashes.

At one extreme, the algorithm minimizes the number of message startups at the expense of an increased amount of time spent in message transmission. At the other extreme, the time spent in message transmission is reduced at the expense of an increased number of message startups. The structure of the algorithms is such that intermediate solutions are feasible, i.e., the number of message startups can be increased slightly and the message transmission time is correspondingly reduced. The ability to configure these algorithms enables the algorithm characteristics to be matched with machine characteristics based on specific overheads for message initiation and link speeds to minimize overall execution time. In effect, the algorithms can be configured to strike the right balance between direct and message combining approaches on a specific architecture for a given problem size.

In both systems, the bandwidth reduction due to non-unit-stride memory access is quite significant and could be more important than the reduction due to contention in the network. These conclusions affect the choice of optimal decompositions for regular domains problems. Thus, although traditional 3D decompositions lead to lower inherent communication-to-computation ratios and could exploit more efficiently the interconnection network, lower dimensional decompositions are found to be more efficient due to the data decomposition effects on the spatial locality of the messages to be communicated. This increasing importance of local optimisations has also been shown using a well-known communication-computation overlapping technique which increases execution time, instead of reducing it as we could expect, due to poor cache memory exploitation."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.888635"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888635"","""",""Concurrent computing";Bandwidth;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Costs;Application software;Cache memory;Microprocessors;Iterative algorithms;Intelligent networks;"Communication networks"","""",""17"",""1"",""34"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

The initialization problem is to assign each of the n stations in the RN a unique ID. The initialization problem is nontrivial since the stations are assumed to be indistinguishable. The problem is fundamental, since practically all communication protocols for RNs proceed under the assumption that the RN has been initialized in advance. The main contribution of this work is to propose energy-efficient randomized initialization protocols for single-hop RNs lacking collision detection capabilities.

Unlike many traditional models that assume all the nodes know global fault distribution, our approach is based on the concept of an extended safety level, which is a special form of limited fault information. The extended safety level information is captured by a vector associated with each node. When the safety level of a node reaches a certain level (or meets certain conditions), a minimal path exists from this node to any nonfaulty nodes in 2D meshes. Specifically, we study the existence of minimal paths at a given source node, limited distribution of fault information, and minimal routing itself. We propose three fault-tolerant minimal routing algorithms which are adaptive to allow all messages to use any minimal path.

However, coherence in shared memory multiprocessors under a relaxed memory model is much more complex to verify automatically. With relaxed memory models, incoming invalidations and outgoing updates can be delayed in each cache while processors are allowed to race ahead. This buffering of memory accesses considerably increases the amount of state in each cache and the complexity of protocol interactions. Moreover, because caches can hold inconsistent copies of the same data for long periods of time, coherence cannot be verified by simply checking that cached copies are identical at all times. This paper makes two major contributions. First, we demonstrate how to model and verify cache coherence under a relaxed memory model in the context of state-based verification methods. Frameworks for modeling the hardware and for generating correct memory access sequences driving the hardware model are developed. We also show correctness properties which must be verified on the hardware model. Second, we demonstrate a successful application of a state-based verification tool called SSM for the verification of the delayed protocol, an aggressive protocol for relaxed memory models. SSM is based on an abstraction technique preserving the properties to verify. We show that with classical, explicit approaches the verification of cache coherence is realistically unfeasible because of the state space explosion problem, whereas SSM is able to verify protocols both at both behavioral and message-passing levels."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.879780"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879780"","""",""Coherence";Access protocols;Hardware;Delay effects;Context modeling;Computer Society;State-space methods;Explosions;Buffer storage;"Testing"","""",""13"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Switch-based interconnects with irregular topology allow the wiring flexibility, scalability, and incremental expansion capability required in this environment. However, the irregularity also makes routing and deadlock avoidance on such systems quite complicated. In current proposals, many messages are routed following nonminimal paths, increasing latency and wasting resources. In this paper, we propose two general methodologies for the design of adaptive routing algorithms for networks with irregular topology. Routing algorithms designed according to these methodologies allow messages to follow minimal paths in most cases, reducing message latency and increasing network throughput. As an example of application, we propose two adaptive routing algorithms for ANI (previously known as Autonet). They can be implemented either by duplicating physical channels or by splitting each physical channel into two virtual channels. In the former case, the implementation does not require a new switch design. It only requires changing the routing tables and adding links in parallel with existing ones, taking advantage of spare switch ports. In the latter case, a new switch design is required, but the network topology is not changed. Evaluation results for several different tapologies and message distributions show that the new routing algorithms are able to increase throughput for random traffic by a factor of up to 4 with respect to the original up*/down* algorithm, also reducing latency significantly. For other message distributions, throughput is increased more than seven times. We also show that most of the improvement comes from the use of minimal routing."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.877816"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877816"","""",""Routing";Workstations;Switches;Network topology;Delay;Throughput;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;"Wiring"","""",""62"",""1"",""37"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

For example, consider a multiprocessor system where incoming tasks with exponentially distributed service requirements arrive as a Poisson process, the tasks must choose a processor for service, and a task knows when making this choice the processor queue lengths from T seconds ago. What is a good strategy for choosing a processor in order for tasks to minimize their expected time in the system? Such models can also be used to describe settings where there is a transfer delay between the time a task enters a system and the time it reaches a processor for service. Our models are based on considering the behavior of limiting systems where the number of processors goes to infinity. The limiting systems can be shown to accurately describe the behavior of sufficiently large systems and simulations demonstrate that they are reasonably accurate even for systems with a small number of processors. Our studies of specific models demonstrate the importance of using randomness to break symmetry in these systems and yield important rules of thumb for system design. The most significant result is that only small amounts of queue length information can be extremely useful in these settings"; for example, having incoming tasks choose the least loaded of two randomly chosen processors is extremely effective over a large range of possible system parameters. In contrast, using global information can actually degrade performance unless used carefully;" for example, unlike most settings where the load information is current, having tasks go to the apparently least loaded server can significantly hurt performance."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.824633"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824633"","""",""Load management";Delay effects;Thumb;Multiprocessing systems;H infinity control;Degradation;Queueing analysis;Computer networks;"Workstations"","""",""119"",""4"",""29"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

Memory management plays an important role in determining the performance of NUMA multiprocessors by dictating the placement of data among the distributed memory modules. We analyze memory traces of several scientific applications for three different memory management techniques, namely buddy, round-robin, and first-touch policies, and compare their memory system performance. Interconnection network switch designs that consider virtual channels and varying number of input buffers per switch are presented. Our performance evaluation is based on execution-driven simulation methodology to capture the dynamic changes in the network traffic during execution of the applications. It is shown that the use of cut-through switching with buffers and virtual channels can Improve the average message latency tremendously. However, the choice of memory management policy affects the amount of network traffic and the network access pattern. Thus, we vary the memory management policy and confirm the performance benefits of improved switch designs. Results of sensitivity studies by varying switch design parameters, cache block size, and memory page size are also presented. We find that a combination of first-touch memory management policy and a switch design with virtual channels and increased buffer space can reduce the average message latency by as high as 70 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.841740"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841740"","""",""Memory management";Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Delay;System performance;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Application software;Computer aided manufacturing;"File servers"","""",""8"","""",""18"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;

However, applying this mechanism to switch-based parallel systems is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose alternative switch architectures with differing buffer organizations to implement multidestination worms on switch-based parallel systems. First, we discuss issues related to such implementation (deadlock-freedom, replication mechanisms, header encoding, and routing). Next, we demonstrate how an existing central-buffer-based switch architecture supporting unicast message passing can be enhanced to accommodate multidestination message passing. Similarly, implementing multidestination worms on an input-buffer-based switch architecture is discussed, and two architectural alternatives are presented that reduce the wiring complexity in a practical switch implementation. The central-buffer-based and input-buffer-based implementations are evaluated against each other, as well as against the corresponding software-based schemes. Simulation experiments under a range of traffic (multiple multicast, bimodal, varying degree of multicast, and message length) and system size are used for evaluation. The study demonstrates the superiority of the central-buffer-based switch architecture. It also indicates that under bimodal traffic the central-buffer-based hardware multicast implementation affects background unicast traffic less adversely compared to a software-based multicast implementation. These results show that multidestination message passing can be applied easily and effectively to switch-based parallel systems to deliver good multicast and collective communication performance."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.877938"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877938"","""",""Switches";Message passing;Traffic control;Unicast;Communication switching;System recovery;Encoding;Routing;Wiring;"Hardware"","""",""6"",""1"",""49"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Some new topologies are introduced: incomplete meshes based on those adaptive routing algorithms designed from the turn model and extended incomplete meshes based on XY routing. We show that the original routing algorithm can be adopted to send a message between any source and destination without using store-and-forward and causing deadlock.

It is well-known that sending each request to the machine with the apparent lowest load can behave badly in such systems, yet this technique is common in practice. Other systems use round-robin or random selection algorithms that entirely ignore load information or that only use a small subset of the load information. Rather than risk extremely bad performance on one hand or ignore the chance to use load information to improve performance on the other, we develop strategies that interpret load information based on its age. Through simulation, we examine several simple algorithms that use such load interpretation strategies under a range of workloads. Our experiments suggest that by properly interpreting load information, systems can: 1) match the performance of the most aggressive algorithms when load information is fresh relative to the job arrival rate, 2) outperform the best of the other algorithms we examine by as much as 60 percent when information is moderately old, 3) significantly outperform random load distribution when information is older still, and 4) avoid pathological behavior even when information is extremely old."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.888643"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888643"","""",""Network servers";Web server;Queueing analysis;Operating systems;Wide area networks;Load modeling;Large-scale systems;Round robin;Pathology;"Load management"","""",""51"",""1"",""40"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

This scheme is based on the parity strategy which is the main idea of the paper. By reducing the communication through the network, a performance improvement is achieved.

In parallel machines with appropriate low-level support, this may open up new opportunities not only to further optimize communication, but also to reduce the synchronization overhead. We present optimization techniques using our framework for eliminating redundant data communication and synchronization operations. Our approach works with the most general data alignments and distributions in languages like High Performance Fortran (HPF) and uses a combination of the traditional data-flow analysis and polyhedral algebra.

For fault tolerance, we consider parity-based as well as mirroring-based techniques with various distribution granularities of the redundant data. We identify several reliability schemes and compare them in terms of the server reliability and per stream cost. To compute the server reliability, we use continuous time Markov chains that are evaluated using the SHARPE software package. Our study covers independent disk failures and dependent component failures. We propose a new mirroring scheme called Grouped One-to-One scheme that achieves the highest reliability among all schemes considered.

The communication model assumed allows an n-dimensional hypercube to have at most n concurrent 110 communications along its ports. It further assumes a distance insensitivity of (n+1) with no intermediate reception capability for the nodes along the communication path. The approach is based on determination of the set of nodes (called stations) in the hypercube such that for any node in the network there is a station at distance of at most 1. Once stations are identified, parallel disjoint paths are formed from the source to all stations. The broadcasting is accomplished first by sending the message to all stations which will in turn inform the rest of the nodes of the message. To establish node-disjoint paths between the source node and all stations, we introduce a new routing strategy.

Two limited randomized routing schemes are then analyzed. The first called Single Randomization yields on average at most N!+1 (N!=O(logN/loglogN)/sup 1/ and is the greatest integer such that (N!)!/spl les/N) network cycles and the second called Multiple Randomization yields on average at most upper bound [log(logN+1)]+2+1/N network cycles for any input permutation.

The problem of minimizing the processing time is investigated by including all the overhead components that could penalize the performance of the system, in addition to the inherent communication and computation delays. These overheads are considered to be constant additive factors to the respective communication and computation components. Closed-form solution for the processing time is derived and the influence of overheads on the optimal processing time is analyzed. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal processing time. We then study the effect of changing the load distribution sequence on the time performance. Through rigorous analysis, an optimal sequence to distribute the load among the processors is identified, whenever it exists. In case such an optimal sequence fails to exist, we present a greedy algorithm to obtain a suboptimal sequence based on some important properties of the overhead factors. Then, the effect of granularity of the data that is divisible is considered in the analysis for the case of homogeneous networks. An integer approximation algorithm capable of generating integer values of the load fractions in time O(m), where m is the number of processors in the network, is proposed.

Typically, these networks connect workstations using irregular topologies, providing the wiring flexibility, scalability, and incremental expansion capability required in this environment. Recently, we proposed two methodologies for the design of adaptive routing algorithms for networks with irregular topology, as well as fully adaptive routing algorithms for these networks. These algorithms increase throughput considerably with respect to previously existing ones, but require the use of at least two virtual channels. In this paper, we propose a very efficient flow control protocol to support virtual channels when link wires are very long and/or have different lengths. This flow control protocol relies on the use of channel pipelining and control flits. Control traffic is minimized by assigning physical bandwidth to virtual channels until the corresponding message blocks or it is completely transmitted. Simulation results show that this flow control protocol performs as efficiently as an ideal network with short wires and flit-by-flit multiplexing. The effect of additional virtual channels per physical channel has also been studied, revealing that the optimal number of virtual channels varies with network size. The use of virtual channel priorities is also analyzed. The proposed flow control protocol may increase short message latency, due to long messages monopolizing channels and hindering the progress of short messages. Therefore, we have analyzed the impact of limiting the number of flits (block size) that a virtual channel may forward once it gets the link. Simulation results show that limiting the maximum block size causes the overall network performance to decrease."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.877939"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877939"","""",""Workstations";Protocols;Network topology;Routing;Wires;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Wiring;Scalability;"Design methodology"","""",""10"",""2"",""28"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

On the other hand, a mesh/torus has a constant node degree and better scalability in this aspect, but the all-to-all personalized exchange algorithms have higher time complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to efficient all-to-all personalized exchange by considering another important type of networks, multistage networks, for parallel computing systems. We present a new all-to-all personalized exchange algorithm for a class of unique-path, self-routable multistage networks. We first develop a generic method for decomposing all-to-all personalized exchange patterns into some permutations which are realizable in these networks, and then present a new all-to-all personalized exchange algorithm based on this method. The newly proposed algorithm has O(n) time complexity for an n/spl times/n network, which is optimal for all-to-all personalized exchange. By taking advantage of fast switch setting of self-routable switches and the property of a single input/output port per processor in a multistage network, we believe that a multistage network could be a better choice for implementing all-to-all personalized exchange due to its shorter communication latency and better scalability."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.841742"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841742"","""",""Intelligent networks";Hypercubes;Scalability;Broadcasting;Parallel processing;Switches;Delay;Distributed computing;Computer Society;"Application software"","""",""40"",""3"",""25"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Clearly, these limits will eventually be exceeded by the growing need for better video quality and larger user population. This paper studies a parallel video server architecture that exploits server parallelism to achieve incremental scalability. First, unlike data partition and replication, the architecture employs data striping at the server level to achieve fine-grain load balancing across multiple servers. Second, a client-pull service model is employed to eliminate the need for interserver synchronization. Third, an admission-scheduling algorithm is proposed to further control the instantaneous load at each server so that linear scalability can be achieved. This paper analyzes the performance of the architecture by deriving bounds for server service delay, client buffer requirement, prefetch delay, and scheduling delay. These performance metrics and design tradeoffs are further evaluated using numerical examples.

The model is validated through simulation and does not rely on the simplifying assumptions of previous models. In addition, the model is valid for the hypercube network. Two new performance-based design constraints are introduced: constant maximum throughput and constant unity queue. These new constraints are fundamentally different than previous constraints, which are based on some characterization of hardware implementation costs. Both of the new constraints allow performance and cost comparisons of different network configurations to be made on the basis of an equal ability to handle a range of traffic load. Results under the new constraints clearly show that a low dimensional network, while offering the lowest message latency, must be significantly more expensive than a comparable high dimensional network and, in some cases, may be impractical to implement.

Recently, by achieving significant reductions in communication delay, the three-dimensional (3D) torus has emerged as a new candidate interconnection topology for message-passing multicomputer systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient processor allocation scheme-scan search scheme-for the 3D torus based on a first-fit approach. The scan search scheme minimizes the average allocation time for an incoming task by effectively manipulating the 3D information on a torus as 2D information using a data structure called the CST (Coverage Status Table). Comprehensive computer simulation reveals that the allocation time of the scan search scheme is always smaller than that of the earlier scheme based on a best-fit approach. The difference gets larger as the input load increases, and it is as much a factor of 3 for high load. To investigate the performance of the proposed scheme in different scheduling environments, we also consider a non-FCFS scheduling policy along with the typical FCFS policy. The allocation time complexity of the scan search scheme is O(LW/sup 2/H/sup 2/). This is significantly smaller than that of the existing scheme which is O(L/sup 4/W/sup 4/H/sup 4/).

Our study has the following objectives: 1) To evaluate the impact of different interacting system components, namely, architecture, operating system, and programming model, on the overall I/O behavior and identify possible performance bottlenecks, and 2) To provide hints to the users for achieving high out-of-box I/O throughput. We find that for the DSM machines that are built as a cluster of SMP nodes, integrated clustering of computing and I/O resources, both hardware and software, is not advantageous for two reasons. First, within an SMP node, the I/O bandwidth is often restricted by the performance of the peripheral components and cannot match the memory bandwidth. Second, since the I/O resources are shared as a global resource, the file-access costs become nonuniform and the I/O behavior of the entire system, in terms of both scalability and balance, degrades. We observe that the buffered I/O performance is determined not only by the I/O subsystem, but also by the programming model, global-shared memory subsystem, and data-communication mechanism. Moreover, programming-model support can be used effectively to overcome the performance constraints created by the architecture and operating system. For example, on the HP Exemplar, users can achieve high I/O throughput by using features of the programming model that balance the sharing and locality of the user buffers and file systems. Finally, we believe that at present, the I/O subsystems are being designed in isolation, and there is a need for mending the traditional memory-oriented design approach to address this problem."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.852403"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852403"","""",""Operating systems";File systems;Performance analysis;Independent component analysis;Throughput;Bandwidth;Scalability;Degradation;Web server;"Instruments"","""","""","""",""35"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

One of the fundamental tasks that have to be addressed when setting up an ad hoc network (AHN, for short) is initialization. This involves assigning each of the n stations in the AHN a distinct ID number (e.g., a local IP address) in the range from 1 to n. Our main contribution is to propose efficient randomized initialization protocols for AHNs. We begin by showing that if the number n of stations is known beforehand, an n-station, single-channel AHN can be initialized with probability exceeding 1-(1/n), in en+O(/spl radic/(nlogn)) time slots, regardless of whether the AHN has collision detection capability. We then go on to show that even if n is not known in advance, an n-station, single-channel AHN with collision detection can be initialized with probability exceeding 1-(1/n), in (10n)/3+O(/spl radic/(n 1n n)) time slots. Using this protocol as a stepping stone, we then present an initialization protocol for the n-station, k-channel AHN with collision detection that terminates with probability exceeding 1-(1/n), in (10n)/(3k)+O(/spl radic/(n 1n n)/k) time slots. Finally, we look at the case where the collision detection capability is not present.

This leader election protocol allows us to design an initialization protocol for the n-station, single-channel AHN with no collision detection that terminates with probability exceeding 1-(1/n), in fewer than 5.67n+O(/spl radic/(n 1n n)) time slots, even if n is not known beforehand. We then discuss an initialization protocol for the n-station, k-channel AHN with no collision detection that terminates with probability exceeding 1-(1/n), in fewer than 5.67(n/k)+O(/spl radic/(n 1n n)/k) time slots, whenever k/spl les/n/((log n)/sup 3/)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.877833"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877833"","""",""Protocols";Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Computer networks;Law enforcement;Computer Society;Multimedia computing;Nominations and elections;Telephony;"Robustness"","""",""90"",""2"",""44"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

Using this design, the corresponding prefix sums can be computed in the time of 4k+[log/sub w/ k]-5 broadcasts."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.877941"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877941"","""",""Broadcasting";Arithmetic;Hardware;Switches;Concurrent computing;Computer Society;Very large scale integration;Delay;Binary sequences;"Computer architecture"","""",""14"","""",""35"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";

When a message encounters a faulty output link, it is removed from the network by the local router and delivered to the messaging layer of the local node's operating system. The message passing software can reroute this message, possibly along nonminimal paths. Alternatively, the message may be addressed to an intermediate node, which will forward the message to the destination. A message may encounter multiple faults and pass through multiple intermediate nodes. The proposed techniques are applicable to both obliviously and adaptively routed networks. The techniques are specifically targeted toward commercial multiprocessors where the mean time to repair (MTTR) is much smaller than the mean time between router failures (MTBF), i.e., it is sufficient to tolerate a maximum of three failures. This paper presents requirements for buffer management, deadlock freedom, and livelock freedom. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the degradation in latency and throughput as a function of the number and distribution of faults. There are several advantages of such an approach. Router designs are minimally impacted, and thus remain compact and fast. Only messages that encounter faulty components are affected, while the machine is ensured of continued operation until the faulty components can be replaced. The technique leverages existing network technology, and the concepts are portable across evolving switch and router designs. Therefore, we feel that the technique is a good candidate for incorporation into the next generation of multiprocessor networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.841738"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841738"","""",""Fault tolerance";Switches;Routing;Communication switching;Operating systems;Message passing;System recovery;Degradation;Delay;"Throughput"","""",""33"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

The model restricts the locations where some turns can be taken so that deadlock is avoided. In comparison with previous methods, the degree of routing adaptiveness provided by the model is more even for different source-destination pairs. The mesh network may benefit from this feature in terms of communication efficiency. Simulation results show that the even adaptiveness provided by the odd-even turn model makes message routing less vulnerable to nonuniform factors such as hot spot traffic. In addition, this property results in a smaller fluctuation of the network performance with respect to different traffic patterns."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.877831"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877831"","""",""Routing";System recovery;Algorithm design and analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Communication system control;Computer Society;Mesh networks;"Fluctuations"","""",""616"",""3"",""23"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

Using a detailed simulation model, the real-time performance of a representative set of classical transaction commit protocols is evaluated. The experimental results show that data distribution has a significant influence on real-time performance and that the choice of commit protocol clearly affects the magnitude of this influence. We also propose and evaluate a new commit protocol, PROMPT (Permits Reading Of Modified Prepared-data for Timeliness), that is specifically designed for the real-time domain. PROMPT allows transactions to """"optimistically"""" borrow, in a controlled manner, the updated data of transactions currently in their commit phase. This controlled borrowing reduces the data inaccessibility and the priority inversion that is inherent in distributed real-time commit processing. A simulation-based evaluation shows PROMPT to be highly successful, as compared to the classical commit protocols, in minimizing the number of missed transaction deadlines. In fact, its performance is close to the best on-line performance that could be achieved using the optimistic lending approach. Further, it is easy to implement and incorporate in current database system software. Finally, PROMPT is compared against an alternative priority inheritance-based approach to addressing priority inversion during commit processing. The results indicate that priority inheritance does not provide tangible performance benefits."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.841752"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841752"","""",""Protocols";Database systems;Real time systems;Application software;Distributed databases;Software systems;Intelligent networks;Electronic commerce;Web sites;"Transaction databases"","""",""62"",""1"",""46"",""IEEE"",""6 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;
