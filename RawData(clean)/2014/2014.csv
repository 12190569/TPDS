The middleware, based on the collected contexts, firstly classifies a service request, e.g., safety-related or comfort service.

In this paper, we study how to leverage network coding to reduce the energy consumed by data encryption in MANETs. It is interesting that network coding has a nice property of intrinsic security, based on which encryption can be done quite efficiently. To this end, we propose P-Coding, a lightweight encryption scheme to provide confidentiality for network-coded MANETs in an energy-efficient way. The basic idea of P-Coding is to let the source randomly permute the symbols of each packet (which is prefixed with its coding vector), before performing network coding operations.

The idea behind this is to exploit the hierarchical addressing structure that allows each router node to compute logical tree distances between source-destination pairs, which approximately mirrors relative hop distance between the pairs, without message exchanges. By exploiting tree distances with a given target address, the SDF algorithm enables RREQ packets to be flooded over a small area, directed towards the destination. We also apply SDF to a lightweight on-demand routing algorithm like AODVjr, and propose two techniques of adaptive timers and route repair that reduces path setup delays and overheads during route rediscovery, respectively. We carry out extensive simulations and quantitatively show that SDF significantly reduces flooding overhead of network-wide flooding (NWF).

The proposed work models the interactions among the CPs as a repeated game among selfish players that aim at maximizing their profit by selling their unused capacity in the spot market but are uncertain of future workload fluctuations. The proposed work first establishes that the uncertainty in future revenue can act as a participation incentive to sharing in the repeated game. We, then, demonstrate how an efficient sharing strategy can be obtained via solving a simple dynamic programming problem. The obtained strategy is a simple update rule that depends only on the current workloads and a single variable summarizing past interactions. In contrast to existing approaches, the model incorporates historical and expected future revenue as part of the virtual machine (VM) sharing decision.

Spectrum auction has emerged as a promising approach to address the access allocation problem in CRNs. A significant challenge in designing such auction is providing truthfulness to avoid market manipulation. In most previous work, the primary access rights on channels are pre-determined before the auction and bidders can only compete for the secondary access rights. However, a user's requirement on spectrum access rights relies on their QoS demands. Therefore, it is much desirable to allocate spectrum access rights on the basis of QoS demands as well as to exploit the resulting spatial spectrum reuse opportunities. To solve this problem, we propose TRUMP, a truthful spectrum auction mechanism, by taking into consideration both QoS demands and spectrum spatial reuse, which can drastically improve spectrum utilization.

The second method translates a model into a source code for both the CPU and the GPU through the internal bytecode, which speeds up the compilation of the generated source codes, because the code size is diminished because of bytecode unification. With large models such that tens of thousands or more expressions can be evaluated simultaneously, the translated code running on the GPU achieves computational performance of up to 2.7 higher than that running on a CPU.

In this paper, we propose a unified sensing coverage architecture for duty cycled wireless sensor networks, called uSense, which features three novel ideas: Asymmetric Architecture, Generic Switching and Global Scheduling. We propose asymmetric architecture based on the conceptual separation of switching from scheduling. Switching is efficiently supported in sensor nodes, while scheduling is done in a separated computational entity, where multiple scheduling algorithms are supported.

The objective is to use the task assignment policy with the best performance (i.e., the one with the least expected waiting time) to assign tasks. Which task assignment policy performs the best depends on the traffic conditions that vary over time. ADAPT-POLICY determines the best task assignment using the service time distribution of tasks (and various other traffic properties), which is estimated on-line and then it adaptively changes the task assignment policy to suit the most recent traffic conditions. The experimental results show that ADAPT-POLICY can result in significant performance improvements over both static and dynamic task assignment policies."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.76"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482132"",""Adaptive task assignment";locality aware task assignment policies;non-parametric density estimation;on-line density estimation;"performance optimisation"",""Estimation";Kernel;Probability density function;Bandwidth;Histograms;Servers;"Arrays"","""",""7"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""19 Mar 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to the autonomous features of entities in CCC, the issues of resource management and reputation management must be jointly addressed in order to ensure the successful deployment of CCC. However, these two issues have typically been addressed separately in previous research efforts, and simply combining the two systems generates double overhead. Also, previous resource and reputation management methods are not sufficiently efficient or effective. By providing a single reputation value for each node, the methods cannot reflect the reputation of a node in providing individual types of resources. By always selecting the highest-reputed nodes, the methods fail to exploit node reputation in resource selection to fully and fairly utilize resources in the system and to meet users' diverse QoS demands. We propose a CCC platform, called Harmony, which integrates resource management and reputation management in a harmonious manner. Harmony incorporates three key innovations: integrated multi-faceted resource/reputation management, multi-QoS-oriented resource selection, and price-assisted resource/reputation control. The trace data we collected from an online trading platform implies the importance of multi-faceted reputation and the drawbacks of highest-reputed node selection.

Most of existing jammer-localization schemes utilize indirect measurements (e.g., hearing ranges) affected by jamming attacks, which makes it difficult to localize jammers accurately. Instead, we exploit a direct measurement-the strength of jamming signals (JSS). Estimating JSS is challenging as jamming signals may be embedded in other signals. As such, we devise an estimation scheme based on ambient noise floor and validate it with real-world experiments. To further reduce estimation errors, we define an evaluation feedback metric to quantify the estimation errors and formulate jammer localization as a nonlinear optimization problem, whose global optimal solution is close to jammers' true positions. We explore several heuristic search algorithms for approaching the global optimal solution, and our simulation results show that our error-minimizing-based framework achieves better performance than the existing schemes.

In this philosophy, users of cloud storage services no longer physically maintain direct control over their data, which makes data security one of the major concerns of using cloud. Existing research work already allows data integrity to be verified without possession of the actual data file. When the verification is done by a trusted third party, this verification process is also called data auditing, and this third party is called an auditor. However, such schemes in existence suffer from several common drawbacks. First, a necessary authorization/authentication process is missing between the auditor and cloud service provider, i.e., anyone can challenge the cloud service provider for a proof of integrity of certain file, which potentially puts the quality of the so-called ‘auditing-as-a-service’ at risk";" Second, although some of the recent work based on BLS signature can already support fully dynamic data updates over fixed-size data blocks, they only support updates with fixed-sized blocks as basic unit, which we call coarse-grained updates. As a result, every small update will cause re-computation and updating of the authenticator for an entire file block, which in turn causes higher storage and communication overheads. In this paper, we provide a formal analysis for possible types of fine-grained data updates and propose a scheme that can fully support authorized auditing and fine-grained update requests. Based on our scheme, we also propose an enhancement that can dramatically reduce communication overheads for verifying small updates.

In this paper, we investigate automated and agile server parameter tuning for maximizing effective throughput of multi-tier Internet applications. A recent study proposed a reinforcement learning based server parameter tuning approach for minimizing average response time of multi-tier applications. Reinforcement learning is a decision making process determining the parameter tuning direction based on trial-and-error, instead of quantitative values for agile parameter tuning. It relies on a predefined adjustment value for each tuning action. However it is nontrivial or even infeasible to find an optimal value under highly dynamic and bursty workloads. We design a neural fuzzy control based approach that combines the strengths of fast online learning and self-adaptiveness of neural networks and fuzzy control. Due to the model independence, it is robust to highly dynamic and bursty workloads. It is agile in server parameter tuning due to its quantitative control outputs. We implemented the new approach on a testbed of virtualized data center hosting RUBiS and WikiBench benchmark applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the new approach significantly outperforms the reinforcement learning based approach for both improving effective system throughput and minimizing average response time."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.115"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497051"",""Automated server parameter tuning";internet applications;autonomic computing;"neural fuzzy control"",""Servers";Tuning;Fuzzy control;Time factors;Throughput;Neurons;"Internet"","""",""9"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""11 Apr 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Several architectures and systems have been proposed and the initial results from specific ISPs and a few torrents have been encouraging. In this work we attempt to deepen and scale our understanding of locality and its potential. Looking at specific ISPs, we consider tens of thousands of concurrent torrents, and thus capture ISP-wide implications that cannot be appreciated by looking at only a handful of torrents. Second, we go beyond individual case studies and present results for few thousands ISPs represented in our data set of up to 40K torrents involving more than 3.9M concurrent peers and more than 20M in the course of a day spread in 11K ASes. Finally, we develop scalable methodologies that allow us to process this huge data set and derive accurate traffic matrices of torrents. Using the previous methods we obtain the following main findings: i) Although there are a large number of very small ISPs without enough resources for localizing traffic, by analyzing the 100 largest ISPs we show that Locality policies are expected to significantly reduce the transit traffic with respect to the default random overlay construction method in these ISPs"; ii) contrary to the popular belief, increasing the access speed of the clients of an ISP does not necessarily help to localize more traffic;" iii) by studying several real ISPs, we have shown that soft speed-aware locality policies guarantee win-win situations for ISPs and end users. Furthermore, the maximum transit traffic savings that an ISP can achieve without limiting the number of inter-ISP overlay links is bounded by “unlocalizable” torrents with few local clients. The application of restrictions in the number of inter-ISP links leads to a higher transit traffic reduction but the QoS of clients downloading “unlocalizable” torrents would be severely harmed."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.109"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497045"",""P2P";BitTorrent;locality;"measurements"",""Peer-to-peer computing";Quality of service;Protocols;Europe;Crawlers;IP networks;"Sociology"","""",""5"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""11 Apr 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

In this context, we are interested in both building an overlay network and providing an explicit algorithm for scheduling the communications. From an optimization point of view, we aim both at maximizing the throughput (i.e., the rate at which nodes receive the message) and minimizing the degree of the participating nodes, i.e., the number of TCP connections they must handle simultaneously. The main novelties of our approach are the introduction of this degree constraint and the classification of the set of participating nodes into two parts: open nodes that stay in the open-Internet and “guarded” nodes that lie behind firewalls or NATs. Two guarded nodes cannot communicate directly, but rather need to use an open node as a gateway for transmitting a message. In the case without guarded nodes, we prove that it is possible to reach the optimal throughput, at the price of a quasi-optimal (up to a small additive increase) degree of the participating nodes. In presence of guarded nodes, our main contributions are a closed form formula for the optimal cyclic throughput and the proof that the optimal solution may require arbitrarily large degrees. In the acyclic case, we propose an algorithm that reaches the optimal throughput with low degree. Then, we prove a worst case ratio between the optimal acyclic and cyclic throughput and show through simulations that this ratio is on average very close to 1, what makes acyclic solutions efficient both in terms of throughput maximization and degree minimization."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.245"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613483"",""Broadcast";scheduling;resource augmentation;NP completeness;approximation algorithms;communication modeling;"firewall"",""Bandwidth";Throughput;Context;Peer-to-peer computing;Overlay networks;Internet;"Approximation methods"","""",""2"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""27 Sep 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

However, a smartphone-based inertial navigation system (INS) faces two serious problems. First, it is subject to errors that accumulate over time rather quickly, which may grow to a level that renders the navigation meaningless. Second, without human input or external references, the smartphone can hardly infer its initial position/velocity, which is the basis for distance calculation, since all that a smartphone can learn is its acceleration. This raises a practical concern, as users often need to start indoor navigation precisely when they are uncertain of their current whereabouts. In this paper, we present Bumping , a Bump-Aided Inertial Navigation method that significantly alleviates the above two problems. At the core of this method is a Bump Matching algorithm, which exploits the position information of the readily available speed bumps to provide useful references for the INS. The proposed method is easy to implement, requires no infrastructures, and incurs nearly zero extra energy. We conducted real experiments in tree parking garages of different environmental characteristics. The Bumping method produces an average position error of 4-5 m in these scenarios, improving the accuracy by up to 87.1 percent, compared to the basic inertial navigation method."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.194"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574847"",""Indoor localization";inertial navigation;smartphones;"vehicles"",""Hidden Markov models";Smart phones;Navigation;Vehicles;Trajectory;Roads;"Accuracy"","""",""28"","""",""10"",""IEEE"",""5 Aug 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

Nowadays, commercial CMPs implement multilevel cache hierarchies that are shared by several multithreaded cores. In this microprocessor design, contention points may appear along the whole memory hierarchy. Moreover, this problem is expected to aggravate in future technologies, since the number of cores and hardware threads, and consequently the size of the shared caches increase with each microprocessor generation. This paper characterizes the impact on performance of the different contention points that appear along the memory subsystem. The analysis shows that some benchmarks are more sensitive to contention in higher levels of the memory hierarchy (e.g., shared L2) than to main memory contention. In this paper, we propose two generic scheduling strategies for CMPs. The first strategy takes into account the available bandwidth at each level of the cache hierarchy. The strategy selects the processes to be coscheduled and allocates them to cores to minimize contention effects. The second strategy also considers the performance degradation each process suffers due to contention-aware scheduling. Both proposals have been implemented and evaluated in a commercial single-threaded quad-core processor with a relatively small two-level cache hierarchy. The proposals reach, on average, a performance improvement by 5.38 and 6.64 percent when compared with the Linux scheduler, while this improvement is by 3.61 percent for an state-of-the-art memory contention-aware scheduler under the evaluated mixes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.61"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471973"",""Contention-aware scheduling";contention points;shared caches;cache hierarchy;"memory contention"",""Benchmark testing";Degradation;Bandwidth;Memory management;Hardware;Processor scheduling;"Microprocessors"","""",""20"","""",""19"",""IEEE"",""7 Mar 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So far, there is no proper profit distribution mechanism to solve this problem. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze such economic issues. Inspired by the idea from cooperative game theory, we propose a cooperative profit-distribution model based on Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), in which both eyeball ISPs and Peer-assisted Content Providers (PCPs) form coalitions and compute a fair Pareto point to determine profit distribution. Moreover, we design a fair and feasible mechanism for profit distribution within each coalition and give a model to discuss the potential competition among ISPs.

However, individual cloud hosted servers are still vulnerable to DDoS attacks if they still run in the traditional way.

To improve driving safety and comfort, the traffic-related status information will be broadcasted regularly and shared among drivers.

Hence, anonymous message authentication is an essential requirement of VANETs. On the other hand, when a vehicle is involved in a dispute event of warning message, the certificate authority should be able to recover the real identity of this vehicle.

Unlike current related studies, which propose only a single principle of self-organisation, this mechanism synthesises the three principles of self-organisation: cloning/spawning, resource exchange and relation adaptation. Based on this mechanism, an agent can autonomously generate new agents when it is overloaded, exchange resources with other agents if necessary, and modify relations with other agents to achieve a better agent network structure. In this way, agents can adapt to dynamic environments. The proposed mechanism is evaluated through a comparison with three other approaches, each of which represents state-of-the-art research in each of the three self-organisation principles.

A standard approach to achieving this goal is to create a network backbone consisting of a subset of nodes that are responsible for data forwarding, while other nodes act as passive receivers. On top of this, network coding (NC) is often used to further reduce unnecessary transmissions. The main problem with existing backbone and NC combinations is that the backbone construction process is blind of what is needed by NC, thus may produce a structure that limits the power of NC algorithms. To address this problem, we propose Coding Opportunity Aware Backbone (COAB) metrics, which seek to maximize coding opportunities when selecting backbone forwarders. We show that the backbone construction process guided by our metrics leads to significantly increased coding frequency, at the cost of minimal localized information exchange. The highlight of our work is COAB's broad applicability and effectiveness. We integrate the COAB metrics with ten state-of-the-art broadcast algorithms specified in eight publications [1]-[8], and evaluate COAB with a running testbed of 30 MICAz nodes and extensively simulations.

Typical techniques treat data quality management as an isolated process for individual nodes.

Within a neighborhood, nodes can trigger additional sensing activities of other nodes when inferred sensing error has aggregately exceeded the tolerance. The main objective of this work is to develop a generic scheduling mechanism for collaborative sensors to achieve the error-bounded scheduling control in monitoring applications. We conducted simulations to investigate system performance using historical soil temperature data in Wisconsin-Minnesota area. The simulation results demonstrate that the system error is confined within the specified error tolerance bounds and that a maximum of 60 percent of the energy savings can be achieved, when the CIES is compared to several fixed probability sensing schemes such as eSense. And further simulation results show the CIES scheme can achieve an improved performance when comparing the metric of a prediction error with baseline schemes.

A key problem for these topologies is the existence of hubs, nodes with high connectivity. Yet, the peers in a typical unstructured P2P network may not be willing or able to cope with such high connectivity and its associated load. Therefore, some hard cutoffs are often imposed on the number of edges that each peer can have, restricting feasible overlays to limited or truncated scale-free networks.

To save this energy wastage, sleep scheduling algorithms can be used to turn the nodes to the sleep state when their radios are not in use and wake them up when necessary. In this paper, we identify the contiguous link scheduling problem in WSNs, in which each node is assigned consecutive time slots so that the node can wake up only once in a scheduling period to fulfil its data collection task. The objective of the problem is to find an interference-free link scheduling with the minimum number of time slots used.

We develop a probabilistically correlated failure (PCF) model to quantify the impact of IP link failure on the reliability of backup paths. With the PCF model, we propose an algorithm to choose multiple reliable backup paths to protect each IP link. When an IP link fails, its traffic is split onto multiple backup paths to ensure that the rerouted traffic load on each IP link does not exceed the usable bandwidth. We evaluate our approach using real ISP networks with both optical and IP layer topologies. Experimental results show that two backup paths are adequate for protecting a logical link.

In traditional point-to-point wireless communication, significant efforts had been made by the existing studies on enhancing the utilization of the channel access time. However, in the emerging wireless network using MU-MIMO, considering only the time domain in channel utilization is not sufficient. As multiple transmitters are allowed to transmit packets simultaneously to the same AP, allowing more antennas at AP would lead to higher channel utilization. Thus, the channel utilization in MU-MIMO should consider both time and spatial domains, i.e., the channel access time and the antenna usage, which have not been considered in the existing methods. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem is lacking of the antenna information of contention nodes in channel contention. To address this issue, we propose a new MAC-PHY architecture design, CUTS, to allow distributed nodes effectively contend for the channel and utilize the channel in both domains. Particularly, CUTS adopts interference nulling to attach the antenna information in channel contention. Meanwhile, techniques such as channel contention in frequency domain and ACK in frequency domain using self-jamming are adopted. Through the software defined radio-based real experiments and extensive simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of our design and illustrate that CUTS provides better channel utilization with the gain over IEEE 802.11 reaching up to 470 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.165"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549104"",""Wireless network";multi-user MIMO;coordination;OFDM;"interference nulling"",""Transmitting antennas";Receiving antennas;Frequency-domain analysis;Interference;"Wireless networks"","""",""29"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""28 Jun 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Existing interpolation methods do not consider these patterns and thus fail to provide a satisfactory accuracy when the missing data rate becomes large.

The first is a holistic integrated scheduling scheme that can handle both static and dynamic segments in a FlexRay network. The second is cost-effective and scalable performance. To address these aspects, we propose a novel holistic scheduling scheme, called HOSA, which can provide scalable performance by using flexible and ease-of-use dual channel communication in FlexRay. HOSA is built upon a novel slot pilfering technique to schedule and optimize the available slots in both static and dynamic segments. Moreover, to achieve efficient implementation, we propose approximate computation, which can efficiently support cost-effective and holistic scheduling by judiciously obtaining the tradeoff between computation complexity and available pilfered slots. HOSA hence offers the salient feature of improving bandwidth utilization. Moreover, to deliver high performance and bridge the gap between real-time communications in networks and storage management in end devices, we implement a deduplication-aware scheme in a real SSD prototype that can reduce space overhead and extend SSD lifespan (by significantly reducing duplicate write operations).

Sliding windows are widely used to facilitate effective event stream processing. However, it is greatly challenged when the event sources are distributed and asynchronous. One important technique to cope with the asynchrony is to utilize that the meaningful snapshots of an asynchronous computation form a distributive lattice. It thus becomes the central challenge whether this lattice structure still preserves and how to maintain it at runtime, when we restrict our attention to events within sliding windows. To address this challenge, we first prove that the snapshots of the asynchronous event streams within the sliding windows form a convex distributive lattice (denoted by Lat-Win). This enables us to easily integrate existing predicate specification and detection techniques, to express and monitor properties of our concern over asynchronous event streams. Then we propose an algorithm to maintain Lat-Win at runtime. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a context-aware smart office scenario, where activities of the user can be recognized by monitoring multiple streams of sensed events. The Lat-Win algorithm is implemented on the open-source context-aware middleware we developed.

However, the peers might be selfish in nature-they would like to receive services from others, but would not like to contribute their own resources by default. To conquer this problem, proper incentive schemes are needed so as to stimulate the peers' contributions. In particular, in P2P video-on-demand (VoD) systems, peers need to distributively cache the proper videos so as to mutually upload and help each other to acquire the required data. Content providers of P2P-VoD services want to incentivize peers to do so and alleviate the workload of the content server. In this paper, we design a practical mechanism to incentivize distributed caching in such systems, under which the peers are rewarded based on the popularity of the video they cache. We characterize the impact of this incentive scheme on peers' caching behaviors.

While multiple channels available in WSN technology such as IEEE 802.15.4 can be exploited to mitigate interference, channel allocation can have a significant impact on the performance of multi-channel communication. This paper proposes a set of distributed protocols for channel allocation in WSNs with theoretical bounds. We first consider the problem of minimizing the number of channels needed to remove interference in a WSN, and propose both receiver-based and link-based distributed channel allocation protocols. Then, for WSNs with an insufficient number of channels, we formulate a fair channel allocation problem whose objective is to minimize the maximum interference (MinMax) experienced by any transmission link in the network. We prove that MinMax channel allocation is NP-hard, and propose a distributed link-based MinMax channel allocation protocol. Finally, we propose a distributed protocol for link scheduling based on MinMax channel allocation that creates a conflict-free schedule for transmissions. The proposed decentralized protocols are efficient, scalable, and adaptive to channel condition and network dynamics. Simulations based on the topologies and data traces collected from a WSN testbed of 74 TelosB motes have shown that our channel allocation protocols significantly outperform a state-of-the-art channel allocation protocol."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.185"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6570720"",""Wireless sensor network";multi-channel;channel allocation;"distributed algorithm"",""Channel allocation";Wireless sensor networks;Interference;Protocols;Receivers;Ad hoc networks;"Resource management"","""",""53"","""",""49"",""IEEE"",""29 Jul 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As centralized solutions over large-scale distributed environments are extremely expensive, inefficient or even infeasible, distributed approaches that rely on partial topology and demand information are the only credible approaches to the service placement problem, even at the expense of non-guaranteed optimality. In this paper, we propose a distributed service migration heuristic that iteratively solves instances of the 1-median problem pushing progressively the service to more cost-effective locations. Key to our algorithm is a traffic-aware centrality metric, called weighted conditional betweenness centrality (wCBC), that captures the ability of a node to act as service demand concentrator and is employed in both selecting the nodes and setting their weights for the 1-median problem instance. The assessment of our heuristic proceeds in two steps. First, assuming (ideal) knowledge of the invoked wCBC metric, we carry out a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristic over synthetic and real-world topologies as well as its advantages against comparable local-search-like migration schemes. Next, we devise practical protocol implementations that approximate the heuristic using local measurements of transit traffic and preserve the excellent accuracy and fast convergence properties of the algorithm for different routing policies.

The goal of the TR-control algorithms is to adapt the stability region to a given set of end-to-end flows. In the algorithms, the flows control distributively the nodes' TRs using the stability region in order to enable higher end-to-end packet rates while guaranteeing stability.

Using dynamic control theory, we consider a full-information model in which, independent of its activation schedule, the sensor will know whether an event has occurred in the last time slot or not. In this case, a simple and optimal greedy policy for the solution is developed. We then further consider a partial-information model where the sensor knows about the occurrence of an event only when it is active. This problem falls into the class of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). Since the POMDP's optimal policy has exponential computational complexity and is intrinsically hard to solve, we propose an efficient heuristic clustering policy and evaluate its performance.

We propose a QoS-aware framework for modeling the enterprise data service problem, and for on-line adaptive processing of distributed RFID data streams. The data processing structure is modeled as a hierarchy of aggregation nodes in accordance with the structure of an organization. Leaf nodes correspond to the RFID streaming inputs. A set of aggregation/deaggregation operations is devised to adjust the processing granularity level based on QoS dynamics. A QoS constrained query issued at any aggregation node is parsed into an aggregation subtree rooted at that node. For QoS-aware processing of the query, several algorithms are designed to dynamically apply proper aggregation/deaggregation operations on selected nodes for raising or lowering the granularity levels or changing the aggregation methods.

In time-constrained flash dissemination scenarios, e.g. earthquake early warning, where time is of the essence, the reliable extensions of the tree-based ALM using ack-based failure recovery protocols cannot support reliable dissemination in the timeframe needed. In this paper, we propose FaReCast which exploits path diversity, i.e., exploit the use of multiple data paths, to achieve fast and reliable data dissemination. First, we design a forest-based M2M (Multiple parents-To-Multiple children) ALM structure where every node has multiple children and multiple parents. The intuition is to enable lower dissemination latency through multiple children, while enabling higher reliability through multiple parents. In order to maintain the M2M ALM structure in a scalable and reliable manner, we develop a DHT-based Distributed Configuration Manager. Second, we design multidirectional multicasting algorithms that effectively utilize the multiple data paths in the M2M ALM structure. A key aspect of our reliable dissemination mechanism is that nodes, in addition to communicating the data to children, also selectively disseminate the data to parents and siblings. As compared to trees using traditional multicasting algorithm, we observe an 80 percent improvement in reliability under 20 percent of failed nodes with no significant increase in latency for over 99 percent of the nodes. Moreover, we notice that FaReCast can reduce the network overhead more than 50 percent by tuning the M2M structure, as compared to the other reliable ALM based disseminations."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.280"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656803"",""Overlay network";flash dissemination;fault resilience;"multicast"",""Reliability";Peer-to-peer computing;Maintenance engineering;Multicast communication;Protocols;Equations;"Ash"","""",""3"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""6 Nov 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there are several factors that often impede its performance: 1) emulation overhead before translation"; 2) translation and optimization overhead; and 3) translated code quality. The issues also include its retargetabilitythat supports guest applications from different instruction-set architectures (ISAs) to host machines also with different ISAs-an important feature to system virtualization. In this work, we take advantage of the ubiquitous multicore platforms, and use a multithreaded approach to implement DBT. By running the translator and the dynamic binary optimizer on different cores with different threads, it could off-load the overhead incurred by DBT on the target applications;" thus, afford DBT of more sophisticated optimization techniques as well as its retargetability. Using QEMU (a popular retargetable DBT for system virtualization) and Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) as our building blocks, we demonstrated in a multithreaded DBT prototype, called Hybrid-QEMU (HQEMU), that it could improve QEMU performance by a factor of 2.6x and 4.1x on the SPEC CPU2006 integer and floating point benchmarks, respectively, for dynamic translation of x86 code to run on x86-64 platforms. For ARM codes to x86-64 platforms, HQEMU can gain a factor of 2.5x speedup over QEMU for the SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks. We also address the performance scalability issue of multithreaded applications across ISAs. We identify two major impediments to performance scalability in QEMU: 1) coarse-grained locks used to protect shared data structures, and 2) inefficient emulation of atomic instructions across ISAs. We proposed two techniques to mitigate those problems: 1) using indirect branch translation caching (IBTC) to avoid frequent accesses to locks, and 2) using lightweight memory transactions to emulate atomic instructions across ISAs.

Hash-based mapping and subtree partitioning are state-of-the-art distributed metadata management schemes. Hash-based mapping evenly distributes workload among metadata servers, but it eliminates all hierarchical locality of metadata. Subtree partitioning does not uniformly distribute workload among metadata servers, and metadata needs to be migrated to keep the load balanced roughly. Distributed metadata management is relatively difficult since it has to guarantee metadata consistency. Meanwhile, scaling metadata performance is more complicated than scaling raw I/O performance. The complexity further rises with distributed metadata. It results in a primary goal that is to improve metadata management scalability while paying attention to metadata consistency. In this paper, we present a ring-based metadata management mechanism named Dynamic Ring Online Partitioning (DROP). It can preserve metadata locality using locality-preserving hashing, keep metadata consistency, as well as dynamically distribute metadata among metadata server cluster to keep load balancing.

Moreover, when no common control channel is available to exchange the control information, this problem is even more difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for constructing virtual backbones in CRNs, without relying on a common control channel. Our approach first utilizes the geographical information to let the nodes of a CRN self-organize into cells. Next, the nodes in each cell form into clusters, and a virtual backbone is established over the cluster heads. The virtual backbone is then applied to carry out the end-to-end data transmission. The proposed virtual backbone construction approach requires only limited exchange of control messages. It is efficient and highly adaptable under the opportunistic spectrum access.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a pure P2P solution for one-view MPVC. We characterize the video source rate region achievable through video relays between peers. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous MPVC systems, we establish tight universal video rate lower bounds that are independent of the number of peers, the number of video sources, and the specific viewing relations between peers.

The service reviews can then be made available to interested users in making wise service selection decisions. We identify three unique service review attacks, i.e., linkability, rejection, and modification attacks, and develop sophisticated security mechanisms for the TSE to deal with these attacks. Specifically, the basic TSE (bTSE) enables users to distributedly and cooperatively submit their reviews in an integrated chain form by using hierarchical and aggregate signature techniques. It restricts the service providers to reject, modify, or delete the reviews. Thus, the integrity and authenticity of reviews are improved. Further, we extend the bTSE to a Sybil-resisted TSE (SrTSE) to enable the detection of two typical sybil attacks. In the SrTSE, if a user generates multiple reviews toward a vendor in a predefined time slot with different pseudonyms, the real identity of that user will be revealed. Through security analysis and numerical results, we show that the bTSE and the SrTSE effectively resist the service review attacks and the SrTSE additionally detects the sybil attacks in an efficient manner.

However, such deterministic approaches usually are inappropriate in modeling energy consumption because of uncertainties in conditional instructions on processors and time-varying external environments (e.g., fluctuant network bandwidth and different user inputs). By adopting a probabilistic approach, this paper proposes a model and a set of algorithms to address the Processor and Voltage Assignment with Probability (PVAP) problem of data-dependent aperiodic tasks in real-time embedded systems, ensuring that all the tasks can be done under the time constraint with a guaranteed probability. We adopt a task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to model the PVAP problem. We first use a processor scheduling algorithm to map the task DAG onto a set of voltage-variable processors, and then use our dynamic programming algorithm to assign a proper voltage to each task. Finally, to escape from local optima, a local search with restarts searches the optimal solution from candidate solutions by updating the objective function, until the stop criteria are reached or a time bound is elapsed. The experimental results demonstrate that for probability 1.0, our approach yields slightly better results than the well-known algorithms like ASAP/ALAP (As Soon As Possible/As Late As Possible) and ILP (Integer Linear Programming) with/without DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling).

The reader has to move around due to the limited communication range of tags. We focus on the minimization of power consumption of the reader given the constraint on its movement distance. Two challenges must be addressed. First, the communication range of a tag is dependent on the reader. There is an intrinsic tradeoff between power saving and movement distance. Second, the number of sites at which the reader can collect tags can be numerous and the problem complexity is extremely high. We theoretically prove that the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of the reader is NP Complete (NPC). To solve the problem, we first analytically reveal that the time needed for reading a given number of tags is linearly proportional to the number of tags only. With this insight, we next propose an approach called ePath by constructing an energy-efficient candidate path and then incrementally pruning the path when the tag locations are given. We further relax the assumption on tag locations by extending ePath to exploit the tag distribution density knowledge only.

How to reduce energy consumption is currently a critical issue in designing HCS. In response to this challenge, many energy-aware scheduling algorithms have been developed primarily using the dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) capability which has been incorporated into recent commodity processors. However, these techniques are unsatisfactory in minimizing both schedule length and energy consumption. Furthermore, most algorithms schedule tasks according to their average-case execution times and do not consider task execution times with probability distributions in the real-world. In realizing this, we study the problem of scheduling a bag-of-tasks (BoT) application, made of a collection of independent stochastic tasks with normal distributions of task execution times, on a heterogeneous platform with deadline and energy consumption budget constraints. We build execution time and energy consumption models for stochastic tasks on a single processor. We derive the expected value and variance of schedule length on HCS by Clark's equations. We formulate our stochastic task scheduling problem as a linear programming problem, in which we maximize the weighted probability of combined schedule length and energy consumption metric under deadline and energy consumption budget constraints. We propose a heuristic energy-aware stochastic task scheduling algorithm called ESTS to solve this problem. Our algorithm can achieve high scheduling performance for BoT applications with low time complexity O(n(M + logn)), where n is the number of tasks and M is the total number of processor frequencies.

Our results show that in heterogeneous geographic distribution where nodes having strong social relations tend to locate more closer, the corresponding capacity is significantly impacted by both social relations and network evolution. In particular, with appropriate control on the initial number of nodes as well as links between them, it is even possible to achieve almost constant per-node capacity except for a poly-logarithmic factor. For homogeneous geographic topology where nodes' positions exhibit uniform distribution, social relations among nodes is useless for improving capacity, which is mainly affected by network evolution and therefore degrades sharply with time.

The accessibility and reliability of Ad-hoc Social Network (ASNET) services can be assured by replication approaches.

We observe that a vehicle has a higher capability of delivering a message to the target region if its own future trajectory or trajectories of those vehicles to be encountered overlap the target region. Motivated by this observation, we develop a message forwarding metric, called coverage capability, to characterize the capability of a vehicle to successfully geocast the message.

Through an empirical study using real vehicular GPS traces of 2,600 taxis, we verify that the travel time of a vehicle, which is modeled as a random variable, follows the Gamma distribution.

However, existing time synchronization protocols in the literature, which can be used for external synchronization, poorly synchronize neighboring nodes. On the other hand, the only protocol that aims at optimizing the synchronization error between neighboring nodes is lack of a mechanism which synchronizes sensor nodes to a reference node, and hence, it cannot provide external synchronization. Therefore, there is a lack in the literature of a time synchronization protocol, which can be used by applications demanding both external synchronization and tight synchronization among neighboring nodes. In this paper, we answer the question of whether it is possible for sensor nodes to synchronize to a reference node while they optimize the clock skew between their neighboring nodes at the same time. Within this context, we present a novel time synchronization protocol, namely External Gradient Time Synchronization Protocol (EGSync). In EGSync, each sensor node synchronizes to a reference node by using time information flooded by this node, as well as synchronizes to its neighboring nodes by employing the agreement algorithm.

In this paper, we consider RFID reader localization which locates an object by attaching it with an RFID reader that communicates with passive RFID tags deployed in the environment. One difficulty in RFID reader localization is that frequent RFID faults can affect localization accuracy. More specifically, in a complex localization environment, metal, water, obstacles, etc., causes some tags to fail to communicate with the reader, and consequently the localization result may deviate from the real location. For permanent faults, existing localization approaches can tolerate only faults that occur at individual tags, by utilizing the redundant information from their neighboring tags. However, these approaches cannot handle permanent faults that occur at a group of neighboring tags in a region, which is referred to as regional permanent fault. They will suffer from serious localization errors if such kind of faults occurs. Moreover, existing work lacks quality measurement of localization results, hence the user may be not aware how serious the localization errors can be. In this paper, we propose an effective fault-tolerant RFID reader localization approach that can handle regional permanent fault, and provide quality measurement of localization results. Our approach is applied to both 2D and 3D localization applications. We further study the network localization problem where some objects know their locations and the other objects determine their locations by measuring the distances to their neighbors.

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing results is derived under a mobility model which is able to reproduce the power law+exponential tail dichotomy of the pairwise node intercontact time distribution which has been observed in traces of several real opportunistic networks. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: first, we present a simple pairwise contact model—called the Home-MEG model—for opportunistic networks based on the observation made in previous work that pairs of nodes in the network tend to meet in very few, selected locations (home locations)";" this contact model is shown to be able to faithfully reproduce the power law+exponential tail dichotomy of intercontact time.

Our design utilizes GPUs memory hierarchy to log runtime data accesses efficiently. To improve the performance, GMRace leverages static analysis to reduce the number of statements that need to be instrumented. Additionally, by exploiting the knowledge of thread scheduling and the execution model in the underlying GPUs, GMRace can accurately detect data races with no false positives reported.

This paper formulates the problem of network-wide energy consumption minimization under the network throughput constraint as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem by jointly optimizing routing, rate control, and power allocation. Moreover, the min-max fairness model is applied to address the fairness issue because the uneven routing problem may incur the sharp reduction of network performance in multi-hop ER-WMNs. Due to the high computational complexity of the formulated mathematical programming problem, an energy-aware multi-path routing algorithm (EARA) is also proposed to deal with the joint control of routing, flow rate, and power allocation in practical multi-hop WMNs. To search the optimal routing, it applies a weighted Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, where the weight is defined as a function of the power consumption and residual energy of a node.

To produce electricity in the smart grid, many micro grids (MGs) may exploit various renewable energy resources. Because the production capacity of renewable resources cannot be controlled, the MGs often require the power plants to provide power for them. However, the power loss between each MG and the power plant is larger than that among the MGs. To alleviate this power loss, we propose a game theoretic coalition formulation strategy for the MGs dubbed GT-CFS. Our proposed GT-CFS allows the MGs (belonging to the same macro station (MS)) to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint MG coalitions. Also, GT-CFS enables the MGs, in a distributed manner, to decide whether they will remain in the coalitions or not upon environmental changes, e.g., the variation of the power demand of the MGs. Within every coalition, MGs coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the MS, in a fashion to optimize a utility function, which captures the total losses over the power distribution lines. MGs in the same coalition will distribute the extra profits (i.e., payoff) produced from forming coalitions by their “Shapley value.” Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GT-CFS reduces the average power loss per MG significantly in contrast with the conventional noncooperative approach."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.178"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565982"",""Coalition game";Shapley value;micro grid;"cooperative game"",""Games";Smart grids;Electricity;Educational institutions;Production;Power generation;"Power demand"","""",""85"",""1"",""24"",""IEEE"",""23 Jul 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While they differ in most aspects, they have in common the fact of being conceived to run on conventional, sequential hardware. On the other hand, parallel hardware is becoming available off-the-shelf: the number of cores inside CPUs is constantly increasing, and CUDA makes it possible to access the power of GPU hardware for general purpose computing.

Many approaches, including hint-based multilevel cache, have been proposed to smooth the gap between different levels. These solutions demote or promote cache blocks based on the latest history information, which is insufficient for applications where frequent demote and promote operations occur. In this paper, we propose a novel multilevel buffer cache using K-step hints (Hint-K) to improve the I/O performance of distributed systems. The basic idea is to promote a block from the lower level cache to the higher level(s) or demote a block vice versa based on the block's previous K-step promote or demote operations, which are referred to as K-step hints. If we make an analogy between Hint-K and LRU-K, then LRU-K keeps track of the times of last K references for blocks within a single cache level, while our Hint-K keeps track of the information of the last K movements (either demote or promote) of blocks among different cache levels. We develop our Hint-K algorithms and design a mathematical model that can efficiently describe the activeness of any block in any cache level. Simulation results show that Hint-K achieves better performance compared to the existing popular multilevel cache schemes such as PROMOTE, DEMOTE, and MQ under different I/O workloads."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.49"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470604"",""Multilevel cache";hints;demote;promote;"I/O performance"",""History";Algorithm design and analysis;Mathematical model;Tracking;Data models;Educational institutions;"Helium"","""",""3"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""25 Feb 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

To address these issues, a polynomial-based scheme was recently introduced. However, this scheme and its extensions all have the weakness of a built-in threshold determined by the degree of the polynomial: when the number of messages transmitted is larger than this threshold, the adversary can fully recover the polynomial. In this paper, we propose a scalable authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

Pattern matching is a well-known problem and extensive research has been conducted for performing effective and efficient search. However, previous proposed approaches assume that data are centrally stored, which is not the case in a mobile environment (e.g., mobile phone networks), where one person's pattern could be separately stored in a number of different stations, and such a local pattern is incomplete compared with the global pattern. A simple solution to pattern matching over a mobile environment is to collect all the data distributed in base stations to a data center and conduct pattern matching at the data center afterwards. Clearly, such a simple solution will raise huge amount of communication traffic, which could cause the communication bottleneck brought by the limited wireless bandwidth to be even worse. Therefore, a communication efficient and search effective solution is necessary. In our work, we present a novel solution which is based on our well-designed weighted bloom filter (WBF), called, Distributed Incomplete pattern matching ( DI-matching), to find target patterns over a distributed mobile environment. Specifically, to save communication cost and ensure pattern matching in distributed incomplete patterns, we use WBF to encode a query pattern and disseminate the encoded data to each base station. Each base station conducts a local pattern search according to the received WBF. Only qualified IDs and corresponding weights in each base station are sent to the data center for aggregation and verification. Through non-trivial theoretical analysis and extensive empirical experiments on a real city-scale mobile networks data set, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solutions."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.128"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509884"",""Incomplete pattern matching";time series;distributed mobile environment;"weighted bloom filter"",""Pattern matching";Base stations;Distributed databases;Time series analysis;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;"Search problems"","""",""3"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""29 Apr 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Compared to the decoder based on the randomly constructed LDPCCC code, the complexity of the proposed LDPCCC decoder is reduced due to the periodicity of the derived LDPCCC and the properties of the quasicyclic structure. In our proposed decoder architecture, Γ (Γ is a multiple of a warp) codewords are decoded together, and hence, the messages of Γ codewords are also processed together. Since all the Γ codewords share the same Tanner graph, messages of the Γ distinct codewords corresponding to the same edge can be grouped into one package and stored linearly. By optimizing the data structures of the messages used in the decoding process, both the read and write processes can be performed in a highly parallel manner by the GPUs. In addition, a thread hierarchy minimizing the divergence of the threads is deployed, and it can maximize the efficiency of the parallel execution.

We argue that in Information-Centric Networking environments, deterministically caching content messages at predefined places along the content delivery path results in unfair and inefficient content multiplexing between different content flows, as well as in significant caching redundancy. Instead, allocating resources along the path according to content flow characteristics results in better use of network resources and therefore, higher overall performance. The design principles of our proposed in-network caching scheme, which we call ProbCache, target these two outcomes, namely reduction of caching redundancy and fair content flow multiplexing along the delivery path. In particular, ProbCache approximates the caching capability of a path and caches contents probabilistically to: 1) leave caching space for other flows sharing (part of) the same path, and 2) fairly multiplex contents in caches along the path from the server to the client. We elaborate on the content multiplexing fairness of ProbCache and find that it sometimes behaves in favor of content flows connected far away from the source, that is, it gives higher priority to flows travelling longer paths, leaving little space to shorter-path flows. We introduce an enhanced version of the main algorithm that guarantees fair behavior to all participating content flows.

More specifically, only one hop of forwarder information, instead of the complete list, is recorded, and the information is updated probabilistically following two ownership flipping models, namely, One-Flip and Always-Flip models. We also use a Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) toolkit to enable fast, configuration-free message exchange. Throughout the paper, we use coupon as a typical type of message to illustrate the core ideas. We have implemented the coupon dissemination system in Java ME.

Although previous studies have applied some classic clustering algorithms such as K-Means and EM for the task, the quality of resultant traffic clusters was far from satisfactory. In order to improve the accuracy of traffic clustering, we propose a constrained clustering scheme that makes decisions with consideration of some background information in addition to the observed traffic statistics. Specifically, we make use of equivalence set constraints indicating that particular sets of flows are using the same application layer protocols, which can be efficiently inferred from packet headers according to the background knowledge of TCP/IP networking. We model the observed data and constraints using Gaussian mixture density and adapt an approximate algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. Moreover, we study the effects of unsupervised feature discretization on traffic clustering by using a fundamental binning method.

This paper seeks to address the problem of hole detection and healing in mobile WSNs. We discuss the main drawbacks of existing solutions and we identify four key elements that are critical for ensuring effective coverage in mobile WSNs: 1) determining the boundary of the RoI, 2) detecting coverage holes and estimating their characteristics, 3) determining the best target locations to relocate mobile nodes to repair holes, and 4) dispatching mobile nodes to the target locations while minimizing the moving and messaging cost. We propose a lightweight and comprehensive solution, called holes detection and healing (HEAL), that addresses all of the aforementioned aspects. The computation complexity of HEAL is O(v2) , where v is the average number of 1-hop neighbors. HEAL is a distributed and localized algorithm that operates in two distinct phases. The first identifies the boundary nodes and discovers holes using a lightweight localized protocol over the Gabriel graph of the network. The second treats the hole healing, with novel concept, hole healing area. We propose a distributed virtual forces-based local healing approach where only the nodes located at an appropriate distance from the hole will be involved in the healing process.

Different from traditional iterative computations, which iteratively update the result based on the result from the previous iteration, DAIC updates the result by accumulating the “changes” between iterations. By DAIC, we can process only the “changes” to avoid the negligible updates. Furthermore, we can perform DAIC asynchronously to bypass the high-cost synchronous barriers in heterogeneous distributed environments. Based on the DAIC model, we design and implement an asynchronous graph processing framework, Maiter. We evaluate Maiter on local cluster as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud.

To simplify graph processing on GPUs, we propose a programming framework called Medusa which enables developers to leverage the capabilities of GPUs by writing sequential C/C++ code. Medusa offers a small set of user-defined APIs and embraces a runtime system to automatically execute those APIs in parallel on the GPU. We develop a series of graph-centric optimizations based on the architecture features of GPUs for efficiency. Additionally, Medusa is extended to execute on multiple GPUs within a machine.

In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of minimizing inter-core communication overhead for streaming applications on bus-based MPSoCs. The objective is to minimize inter-core communication overhead while minimizing the overall memory usage. To solve the problem, we first let tasks with intra-period data dependencies transform to inter-period data dependencies so as to overlap the execution of computation and inter-core communication tasks. By doing this, inter-core communication overhead can be effectively removed. To minimize the overall memory usage, we then perform schedulability analysis and obtain the bounds of the times needed to reschedule each task. Based on the schedulability analysis, we formulate the scheduling problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) model and obtain an optimal schedule. In addition, we propose a heuristic approach to efficiently obtain a near-optimal solution.

Therefore, mobile users are often at risk since they may not have any prior knowledge about others who are socially connected. To address this problem, trust inference plays a critical role for establishing social links between mobile users in MSNs. Taking into account the nonsemantical representation of trust between users of the existing trust models in social networks, this paper proposes a new fuzzy inference mechanism, namely MobiFuzzyTrust, for inferring trust semantically from one mobile user to another that may not be directly connected in the trust graph of MSNs. First, a mobile context including an intersection of prestige of users, location, time, and social context is constructed. Second, a mobile context aware trust model is devised to evaluate the trust value between two mobile users efficiently. Finally, the fuzzy linguistic technique is used to express the trust between two mobile users and enhance the human's understanding of trust.

Among these, radio map based technologies (also referred as fingerprinting technologies) are attractive due to high accuracy and easy deployment. However, these technologies have not been extensively applied on real environment for two fatal limitations. First, it is hard to localize multiple objects. When the number of target objects is unknown, constructing a radio map of multiple objects is almost impossible. Second, environment changes will generate different multipath signals and severely disturb the RSS measurement, making laborious retraining inevitable. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Line-of-sight radio map matching, which only reserves the LOS signal among nodes. It leverages frequency diversity to eliminate the multipath behavior, making RSS more reliable than before.

Through extensive experiments, it shows that the accuracy does not decrease when localizing multiple targets in a dynamic environment.

The GSP auction provides incentives for rational nodes to cooperate and results in truth-telling Nash equilibria. With the possible inclusion of Byzantine nodes in the least cost paths selected by GSP, the FORBID mechanism builds a decentralized reputation system such that malicious behavior is effectively detected.

In this paper, focusing on partitioned-EDF scheduling and MSRP resource access protocol, we study the utilization bound and efficient task mapping schemes for a set of periodic real-time tasks that access shared resources in multiprocessor/multicore systems. Specifically, with synchronization overhead being considered, we illustrate the schedulability anomaly for such systems. We develop the first synchronization-cognizant utilization bound and further analyze its non-monotonicity where the bound can decrease when more processors are deployed. Then, we show that finding the optimal mapping for tasks with shared resources is NP-hard. Based on a novel approach that iteratively tightens the synchronization overhead, we propose two efficient synchronization-cognizant task mapping algorithms (SC-TMA) with the goal of achieving better schedulability and balanced workload on deployed processors. Finally, the proposed SC-TMA schemes are evaluated through extensive simulations with synthetic tasks. The results show that, the schedulability ratio and (average) system load under SC-TMA are close to that of an INLP (Integer Non-Linear Programming) based solution for small task systems.

In this paper, we propose the shortcut tree routing (STR) protocol that provides the near optimal routing path as well as maintains the advantages of the ZigBee tree routing such as no route discovery overhead and low memory consumption. The main idea of the shortcut tree routing is to calculate remaining hops from an arbitrary source to the destination using the hierarchical addressing scheme in ZigBee, and each source or intermediate node forwards a packet to the neighbor node with the smallest remaining hops in its neighbor table. The shortcut tree routing is fully distributed and compatible with ZigBee standard in that it only utilizes addressing scheme and neighbor table without any changes of the specification. The mathematical analysis proves that the 1-hop neighbor information improves overall network performances by providing an efficient routing path and distributing the traffic load concentrated on the tree links. In the performance evaluation, we show that the shortcut tree routing achieves the comparable performance to AODV with limited overhead of neighbor table maintenance as well as overwhelms the ZigBee tree routing in all the network conditions such as network density, network configurations, traffic type, and the network traffic."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2014.9"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6731389"",""ZigBee";tree routing;shortcut tree routing (STR);neighbor table;MANET;WSN;"IEEE 802.15.4"",""Routing";Routing protocols;Zigbee;Standards;Traffic control;"Topology"","""",""38"",""3"",""26"",""IEEE"",""4 Feb 2014"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

First, whole packet forwarding (WPF) re-allocates a nonempty VC if the VC has enough free buffers for an entire packet. WPF does not induce deadlock if the routing algorithm is deadlock-free using conservative VC re-allocation. It is an important extension to several deadlock avoidance theories.

To achieve omnidirectional coverage under such link-centric architecture, we propose the concept of omnidirectional passive human detection. The rationale is to exploit the rich multipath effect to blur the directional coverage. We harness PHY layer features to robustly capture the fine-grained multipath characteristics and virtually tune the shape of the coverage of the monitoring unit, which is previously prohibited with mere MAC layer RSSI. We design a fingerprinting scheme and a threshold-based scheme with off-the-shelf WiFi infrastructure and evaluate both schemes in typical clustered indoor scenarios.

A node compressively describes its data items as a Bloom filter, which is then diffused away to the other nodes with information decay. The Bloom filters form an information potential that eventually navigates queries to the source node by ascending the potential field. The existing designs of Bloom filters, however, have critical limitations with respect to the feasibility of gradient-based routing. The compressed routing entries appear to be noisy. Noise in unrelated routing entries is very likely to equal to even outweigh information in right routing entries, thus blinding a query to its desired destination. This work addresses the root cause of the mismatch between the ideal and the practical performance of gradient-based routing using Bloom filters. We first investigate the impact of decaying model on the effectiveness of routing entries, and then evaluate the negative impact of noise on routing decisions. Based on such analytical results, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition of feasible gradient-based routing using Bloom filters. Accordingly, we propose a receiver-oriented design of Bloom filters, called Wader, which satisfies the necessary and sufficient condition.

A closer look at the network activities of a cognitive radio network reveals that the access pattern of a primary user (PU) typically consists of a succession of transmission periods, alternating with idle periods, each of which lasts a number of time slots. Based on this observation, it becomes clear that forcing the SU to sense the channel at the beginning of each time slot is unnecessary and may lead to considerable waste of energy. The main objective of this paper is to investigate new approaches for spectrum sensing by exploring the tradeoffs between energy consumption and secondary network throughput. To this end, we propose a stochastic, energy-aware model to derive the optimal spectrum sensing interval an SU can use to dynamically determine when the next spectrum sensing should be performed. The proposed model allows an SU to adaptively derive the sensing interval based on its required quality of service and current network state, including the PU's network activities and traffic load.

Since each simulation needs one workload as input, only real workloads with usually a limited availability are not sufficient, and so representative workload models are needed. Several studies have shown that realistic workload characteristics such as burstiness, bag-of-tasks, etc., cause significant performance impacts on scheduling. Therefore, we argue that realistic workload models should contain as many characteristics of real workloads as possible. In practice, researchers use unrealistic workloads in their scheduling evaluations because they lack models that can help generate realistic workloads. In this article, we analyze real parallel workloads to show the presence of important characteristics including long range dependence, periodicity and temporal burstiness of job arrivals, bag-of-tasks behavior, and correlation of runtime and number of processors.

The proposed model approximates the mean waiting time for a given class based on the higher and lower priority tasks receiving service prior to the target and the mean residual service time experienced. Additional time caused by preemptions is estimated as part of mean request completion time for a given class and as part of the mean delay experienced due to jobs in execution, on an arrival.

EDF achieves best waiting times for higher priorities in lower to moderate loads (0.2-0.6) and while only being 6.5 times more than static priority algorithms in high loads (0.9).

Often design space exploration is performed to optimize execution time, latency or throughput of a pipelined MPSoC where the variants in the system are processor configurations due to customizable options in each of the processors. Since there can be billions of combinations of processor configurations (design points), the challenge is to quickly provide estimates of performance metrics of those design points. Hence, in this article, we propose analytical models to estimate execution time, latency and throughput of a pipelined MPSoC's design points, avoiding slow full-system cycle accurate simulations of all the design points. For effective use of these analytical models, latencies of individual processor configurations should be available. We propose two estimation methods (PS and PSP) to quickly gather latencies of processor configurations with reduced number of simulations. The PS method simulates all the processor configurations once, while the PSP method simulates only a subset of processor configurations and then uses a processor analytical model to estimate the latencies of the remaining processor configurations. We experimented with several pipelined MPSoCs executing typical multimedia applications (JPEG encoder/decoder, MP3 encoder and H.264 encoder). Our results show that the analytical models with PS and PSP methods had maximum absolute error of 12.95 percent and 18.67 percent respectively, and minimum fidelity of 0.93 and 0.88 respectively. The design spaces of the pipelined MPSoCs ranged from 1012 to 1018 design points, and hence simulation of all design points will take years and is infeasible. Compared to PS method, the PSP method reduced simulation time from days to several hours."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.268"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636892"",""Dataflow architectures";heterogeneous (hybrid) systems;measurement;evaluation;modeling;"simulation of multiple-processor systems"",""Program processors";Analytical models;Clocks;Estimation;Multimedia communication;Throughput;"Steady-state"","""",""11"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""18 Oct 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of previous works adopt a greedy approach for maximizing the received number of segments by making full use of the available network bandwidth to make that a peer can receive its requested segments as soon as possible. However, the greedy approach will cause the traffic burst on the network and adversely decrease the network capacity. They also suffer from needing larger disk memory for storing the received segments which are not played yet. To address the two issues for efficiently using the limited network bandwidth and saving disk memory, this paper proposes a distinct segment scheduling algorithm by scheduling the segments evenly transmitted into the network according to the playback rate of the MoD streaming service.

Compared to conventional CDNs, cloud-based CDNs have the benefit of cost efficient hosting services without owning infrastructure. However, resource provisioning and replica placement in cloud CDNs involve a number of challenging issues, mainly due to the dynamic nature of demand patterns. To deal with this dynamic nature, this paper proposes a set of novel algorithms to solve the joint problem of resource provisioning and caching (i.e., replica placement) for cloud-based CDNs with an emphasis on handling the dynamic demand patterns. Firstly, we propose a provisioning and caching algorithm framework called Differential Provisioning and Caching (DPC) algorithm, which aims to rent cloud resources to build CDNs and whereby to cache contents so that the total rental cost can be minimized while all demands are served. DPC consists of 2 steps. Step 1 first maximizes total demands supported by unexpired resources. Then, step 2 minimizes the total rental cost for new resources to serve all remaining demands. For each step we design both greedy and iterative heuristics, each with different advantages over the existing approaches. Moreover, to dynamically adjusts the placement of contents and route maps, we further propose the Caching and Request Balancing (CRB) algorithm, which is light-weight and thus can be frequently executed as a companion of DPC to maximize the total demands.

But for protecting data privacy, sensitive data have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which obsoletes traditional data utilization based on plaintext keyword search. Thus, enabling an encrypted cloud data search service is of paramount importance. Considering the large number of data users and documents in the cloud, it is necessary to allow multiple keywords in the search request and return documents in the order of their relevance to these keywords. Related works on searchable encryption focus on single keyword search or Boolean keyword search, and rarely sort the search results. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the challenging problem of privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data in cloud computing (MRSE). We establish a set of strict privacy requirements for such a secure cloud data utilization system. Among various multi-keyword semantics, we choose the efficient similarity measure of """"coordinate matching,"""" i.e., as many matches as possible, to capture the relevance of data documents to the search query. We further use """"inner product similarity"""" to quantitatively evaluate such similarity measure. We first propose a basic idea for the MRSE based on secure inner product computation, and then give two significantly improved MRSE schemes to achieve various stringent privacy requirements in two different threat models. To improve search experience of the data search service, we further extend these two schemes to support more search semantics. Thorough analysis investigating privacy and efficiency guarantees of proposed schemes is given.

Our analysis shows that the blind mechanism performs better under random primary user activity, the difference being more pronounced when the number of channels is high and/or primary user activity is more intense.

In this work, we exploit the geographic opportunistic routing (GOR) for QoS provisioning with both end-to-end reliability and delay constraints in WSNs. Existing GOR protocols are not efficient for QoS provisioning in WSNs, in terms of the energy efficiency and computation delay at each hop.

As a result, power management of a multi-core chip has become an important issue in the design of embedded real-time systems. Most existing approaches have been designed to regulate the behavior of average power consumption, such as minimizing the total energy consumption or the chip temperature. However, little attention has been paid to the worst-case behavior of instantaneous power consumption on a chip, called chip-level peak power consumption, an important design parameter that determines the cost and/or size of chip design/packaging and the underlying power supply. We address this problem by reducing the chip-level peak power consumption at design time without violating any real-time constraints. We achieve this by carefully scheduling real-time tasks, without relying on any additional hardware implementation for power management, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Specifically, we propose a new scheduling algorithm FPΘ that restricts the concurrent execution of tasks assigned on different cores, and perform its schedulability analysis. Using this analysis, we develop a method that finds a set of concurrent executable tasks, such that the design-time chip-level peak power consumption is minimized and all timing requirements are met. We demonstrate via simulation that the proposed method not only keeps the design-time chip-level peak power consumption as low as the theoretical lower bound for trivial cases, but also reduces the peak power consumption for non-trivial cases by up to 12.9 percent compared to the case of no restriction on concurrent task execution."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.131"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514878"",""Peak power consumption";system design;multi-core systems;"real-time scheduling"",""Power demand";Scheduling algorithms;Real-time systems;Multicore processing;"Timing"","""",""25"","""",""24"",""IEEE"",""13 May 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose a reliable multicast protocol, called CodePipe, with energy-efficiency, high throughput and fairness in lossy wireless networks. Building upon opportunistic routing and random linear network coding, CodePipe can not only eliminate coordination between nodes, but also improve the multicast throughput significantly by exploiting both intra-batch and inter-batch coding opportunities.

By grouping nodes into increasingly large rigid components, component-based localization algorithms can properly conquer network sparseness and anchor sparseness. However, such design is sensitive to measurement errors. Existing robust localization methods focus on eliminating the positioning error of a single node. Indeed, a single node has two dimensions of freedom in 2D space and only suffers from one type of transformation: translation. As a rigid 2D structure, a component suffers from three possible transformations: translation, rotation, and reflection. A high degree of freedom brings about complicated cases of error productions and difficulties on error controlling.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to automated response called the response and recovery engine (RRE). Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. The RRE applies attack-response trees (ART) to analyze undesired system-level security events within host computers and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower level attack consequences. In addition, the RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. The RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. To support network-level multiobjective response selection and consider possibly conflicting network security properties, we employ fuzzy logic theory to calculate the network-level security metric values, i.e., security levels of the system's current and potentially future states in each stage of the game. In particular, inputs to the network-level game-theoretic response selection engine, are first fed into the fuzzy system that is in charge of a nonlinear inference and quantitative ranking of the possible actions using its previously defined fuzzy rule set. Consequently, the optimal network-level response actions are chosen through a game-theoretic optimization process. Experimental results show that the RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 500 nodes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.211"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583161"",""Security";Subspace constraints;Engines;Games;Computers;Markov processes;Uncertainty;and fuzzy logic and control;Intrusion response systems;network state estimation;Markov decision processes;"stochastic games"",""Security";Subspace constraints;Engines;Games;Computers;Markov processes;"Uncertainty"","""",""94"","""",""24"",""IEEE"",""21 Aug 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

In this paper, we identify distinct design issues for protecting continuous in-network aggregation and propose a novel scheme to detect false temporal variation patterns.

Although convergent encryption has been extensively adopted for secure deduplication, a critical issue of making convergent encryption practical is to efficiently and reliably manage a huge number of convergent keys. This paper makes the first attempt to formally address the problem of achieving efficient and reliable key management in secure deduplication. We first introduce a baseline approach in which each user holds an independent master key for encrypting the convergent keys and outsourcing them to the cloud. However, such a baseline key management scheme generates an enormous number of keys with the increasing number of users and requires users to dedicatedly protect the master keys. To this end, we propose Dekey , a new construction in which users do not need to manage any keys on their own but instead securely distribute the convergent key shares across multiple servers. Security analysis demonstrates that Dekey is secure in terms of the definitions specified in the proposed security model. As a proof of concept, we implement Dekey using the Ramp secret sharing scheme and demonstrate that Dekey incurs limited overhead in realistic environments."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.284"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658753"",""Deduplication";proof of ownership;convergent encryption;"key management"",""Encryption";Reliability;Servers;"Data deduplication"","""",""365"",""5"",""33"",""IEEE"",""8 Nov 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The social-based Q&A systems can answer non-factual questions, which cannot be easily resolved by web search engines. These systems either rely on a centralized server for identifying friends based on social information or broadcast a user's questions to all of its friends. Mobile Q&A systems, where mobile nodes access the Q&A systems through Internet, are very promising considering the rapid increase of mobile users and the convenience of practical use. However, such systems cannot directly use the previous centralized methods or broadcasting methods, which generate high cost of mobile Internet access, node overload, and high server bandwidth cost with the tremendous number of mobile users. We propose a distributed Social-based mObile Q&A System (SOS) with low overhead and system cost as well as quick response to question askers. SOS enables mobile users to forward questions to potential answerers in their friend lists in a decentralized manner for a number of hops before resorting to the server. It leverages lightweight knowledge engineering techniques to accurately identify friends who are able to and willing to answer questions, thus reducing the search and computation costs of mobile nodes. The trace-driven simulation results show that SOS can achieve a high query precision and recall rate, a short response latency and low overhead.

While additional temporal and spatial information provides better approximation of network status for global load-balancing.

We propose the Multi-Pheromone ACO-based (MP-ACO) selection scheme which adopts the concept of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from stock market. We implement a novel ACO system where ants lay two kinds of pheromones with different evaporation rates. The temporal pheromone variation can help to capture hidden-state dependencies of upcoming congestion status. Secondly, to acquire the spatial range of congestion information, we propose Regional-Aware ACO-based (RA-ACO) selection to record historical buffer information from routers within two-hop of distances, which helps to extend spatial pheromone coverage. Information provided by the proposed two schemes improves the system performance.

We show that existing 2D plane coverage is merely a special case of surface coverage. Simulations point out that existing sensor deployment schemes for a 2D plane cannot be directly applied to surface coverage cases. Thus, we target two problems assuming cases of surface coverage to be true. One, under stochastic deployment, what is the expected coverage ratio when a number of sensors are adopted?

Auction is an efficient way to allocate resources to those who value them the most. The large pool of spectrums to be released, especially the ones in TV Whitespace, consist of wide-range frequencies. Apart from spatial reuse, spectrum heterogeneity imposes new challenges for spectrum auction design: 1) Wireless service providers with different targeted cell coverages have different spectrum frequency preferences";" 2) interference relationship is frequency-dependent due to frequency-selective signal fading. Unfortunately, existing spectrum auction mechanisms either assume spectrum valuation is homogeneous or use homogeneous interference graph to group buyers who can reuse the same spectrum. In this paper, we propose TAMES, an auction framework for heterogeneous spectrum transaction. We consider a multi-seller-multi-buyer double auction, in which every buyer submits a bid, consisting of the spectrum demand and a bidding profile of prices for spectrums contributed by all sellers.

Wide geographical spreads of participants in large-scale DIAs necessitate distributed deployment of servers to improve interactivity. In a distributed server architecture, the interactivity performance depends on not only client-to-server network latencies but also interserver network latencies, as well as synchronization delays to meet the consistency and fairness requirements of DIAs. All of these factors are directly affected by how the clients are assigned to the servers. In this paper, we investigate the problem of effectively assigning clients to servers for maximizing the interactivity of DIAs. We focus on continuous DIAs that changes their states not only in response to user operations but also due to the passing of time. We analyze the minimum achievable interaction time for DIAs to preserve consistency and provide fairness among clients, and formulate the client assignment problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. We prove that this problem is NP-complete. Three heuristic assignment algorithms are proposed and their approximation ratios are theoretically analyzed.

This paper proposes the human network (HUNET), a network architecture that enables information sharing between mobile devices through direct interdevice communication. We design B-SUB, an interest-driven information sharing system for HUNETs. In B-SUB, content and user interests are described by tags, which are human-readable strings that are designated by users.

To facilitate efficient data dissemination, we invent the Temporal Counting Bloom filter (TCBF) to encode tags, which also reduces the overhead of content routing. Comprehensive theoretical analyses on the parameter tuning of B-SUB are presented and verify B-SUB's ability to work efficiently under various network conditions.

For the purpose of improving performance and reducing energy consumption, this paper proposes to adapt the cache coherence policy for threads according to their delay-tolerant levels. Specifically, this paper proposes Thread progrEss Aware Coherence Adaption (TEACA) which utilizes the thread progress information as hints for coherence adaption.

To achieve network-wide time synchronization, a common strategy is to flood current time information of a reference node into the network, which is utilized by the de facto time-synchronization protocol Flooding Time-Synchronization Protocol (FTSP). In FTSP, the propagation speed of the flood is slow because each node waits for a given period of time to propagate its time information about the reference node. It has been shown that slow-flooding decreases the synchronization accuracy and scalability of FTSP drastically. Alternatively, rapid-flooding approach is proposed in the literature, which allows nodes to propagate time information as quickly as possible. However, rapid flooding is difficult and has several drawbacks in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, our aim is to reduce the undesired effect of slow-flooding on the synchronization accuracy without changing the propagation speed of the flood. Within this context, we realize that the smaller the difference between the speeds of the clocks, the smaller the undesired effect of waiting times on the synchronization accuracy. In the light of this realization, our main contribution is to show that the synchronization accuracy and scalability of slow-flooding can drastically be improved by employing a clock speed agreement algorithm among the sensor nodes. We present an evaluation of this strategy on a testbed setup including 20 MICAz sensor nodes.

Each method claims the better performance among all the others according to their own considerations and environments. However, there must be one standing out of the rest. In this paper, we focus on this part of work. The difficulty is that there does not exist a universal standard to evaluate them. In order to address this problem, we carry out a series of empirical and theoretical analysis on the basis of the introduced mathematical model. Based on this mathematical platform, each method will be evaluated by using real OSN data. We have done three types of analysis in this work. First, we compare all the measures of locating important users. The results suggest that the degree and betweenness measures outperform all the others in the Facebook network. Second, we analyze the method of the truth clarification method, and find that this method has a long-term performance while the degree measure performs well only in the early stage. Third, in order to leverage these two methods, we further explore the strategy of different methods working together and their equivalence.

These VCs are usually customized and deployed per job in runtime. Allocating physical resources for VC is known as Virtual Cluster Mapping (VCM) problem, which is a critical issue that affects both performance of the VC and resource utilization of the system. Most previous works treat all Virtual Machines (VMs) in a VC request equally. However, because sub-jobs in a parallel job usually perform different roles, the corresponding VMs in a VC that execute these sub-jobs respectively should have different levels of importance. Based on this argument, this paper introduces the concept of partial VC mapping in contrast to the full mapping methodology in the current literatures. To fulfill partial mapping, the important backbone communication structure of parallel job called Communication Skeleton (CS) is derived based on the network topology among virtual nodes. To generate the CS of a job, mechanisms for evaluating the importance of nodes are proposed. Eventually, a Topology-aware Partial Virtual Cluster Mapping algorithm (TOP-VCM) is proposed which is based on sub-graph isomorphism detection. TOP-VCM can fully satisfy the nodes/links requirements in CS to ensure the execution performance with only slight degradation of other trivial nodes/links to significantly reduce the mapping difficulty.

Such cheating behavior may harm other users and thus lead to poor system throughput. Given the threat of selfish users' cheating, our objective in this paper is to suppress the cheating behavior of selfish users in cooperative relay.

In a cost-efficient cloud environment, a user can tolerate a certain degree of delay while retrieving information from the cloud to reduce costs. In this paper, we address two fundamental issues in such an environment: privacy and efficiency. We first review a private keyword-based file retrieval scheme that was originally proposed by Ostrovsky. Their scheme allows a user to retrieve files of interest from an untrusted server without leaking any information. The main drawback is that it will cause a heavy querying overhead incurred on the cloud and thus goes against the original intention of cost efficiency. In this paper, we present three efficient information retrieval for ranked query (EIRQ) schemes to reduce querying overhead incurred on the cloud. In EIRQ, queries are classified into multiple ranks, where a higher ranked query can retrieve a higher percentage of matched files. A user can retrieve files on demand by choosing queries of different ranks. This feature is useful when there are a large number of matched files, but the user only needs a small subset of them. Under different parameter settings, extensive evaluations have been conducted on both analytical models and on a real cloud environment, in order to examine the effectiveness of our schemes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.132"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6515116"",""Cloud computing";cost efficiency;differential query services;"privacy"",""Privacy";Organizations;Encryption;Servers;"Matched filters"","""",""20"","""",""20"",""USGov"",""13 May 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It follows that any effort to protect driver privacy must attempt to make the link between the two harder to detect. One of the most appealing solutions to hiding the identity of a vehicle is the use of pseudonyms, whereby each vehicle is issued one or several temporary identities (i.e., pseudonyms) that it uses to communicate with other vehicles and/or the roadside infrastructure. Due to the large number of vehicles on our roadways and city streets and of the sophistication of possible attacks, privacy protection must be both scalable and robust. The first main contribution of this work is to take a nontrivial step towards providing a scalable and robust solution to privacy protection in vehicular networks. To promote scalability and robustness we employ two strategies. First, we view vehicular networks as consisting of nonoverlapping subnetworks, each local to a geographic area referred to as a cell. Depending on the topology and the nature of the area, these cells may be as large as few city blocks or, indeed, may comprise the entire downtown area of a small town. Each cell has a server that maintains a list of pseudonyms valid for use in the cell. Instead of issuing pseudonyms to vehicles proactively, as virtually all existing schemes do, we issue pseudonyms only to those vehicles that request them. Our second main contribution is to model analytically the time-varying request for pseudonyms in a given cell. This is important for capacity planning purposes since it allows system managers to predict, by taking into account the time-varying attributes of the traffic, the probability that a given number of pseudonyms will be required at a certain time as well as the expected number of pseudonyms in use in a cell at a certain time.

In this paper, we mine the extensive data sets of vehicular traces from two large cities in China, i.e., Shanghai and Shenzhen, through conditional entropy analysis, we find that there exists strong spatiotemporal regularity with vehicle mobility.

To cope with the increasing number of subscribers and with the spatiotemporal variations of the wireless signals, current cellular networks use opportunistic schedulers, such as the Proportional Fairness scheduler (PF), to maximize network throughput while maintaining fairness among users. Such scheduling decisions are based on channel quality metrics and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) feedback reports provided by the User's Equipment (UE). Implicit in current networks is the a priori trust on every UE's feedback. Malicious UEs can, thus, exploit this trust to disrupt service by intelligently faking their reports. This work proposes a trustworthy version of the PF scheduler (called TPF) to mitigate the effects of such Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In brief, based on the channel quality reported by the UE, we assign a probability to possible ARQ feedbacks. We then use the probability associated with the actual ARQ report to assess the UE's reporting trustworthiness. We adapt the scheduling mechanism to give higher priority to more trusted users. Our evaluations show that TPF 1) does not induce any performance degradation under benign settings, and 2) it completely mitigates the effects of the activity of malicious UEs. In particular, while colluding attackers can obtain up to 77 percent of the time slots with the most sophisticated attack, TPF is able to contain this percentage to as low as 6 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.144"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519232"",""misreporting attack";Cellular networks;PF scheduler;"trust"",""Lifting equipment";Automatic repeat request;Downlink;Throughput;Maximum likelihood estimation;Protocols;"Base stations"","""",""4"","""",""18"",""IEEE"",""23 May 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Multiagent computing has already been widely envisioned to be a powerful paradigm for modeling autonomous multientity systems; therefore, it is promising to connect the research on social networks and multiagent systems. In general, there are three views for research on social networks: the structure-oriented view, in which only the network structure characteristics among actors are considered, the actor-oriented view, in which only the behavior characteristics of actors are considered, and the actor-structure crossing view, in which both actors and network structures are considered and their crossing effects are explored. This survey paper mainly concerns studies on social networks that have the last two views and discusses the relationship between social networks and multiagent systems. Because coordination is critical for both multiagent systems and social networks, this paper classifies studies on social networks that are based on the coordination mechanisms among the actors in the social networks. By referring to typical types of coordination situations in multiagent systems, social networks in previous studies can be classified into three classes: cooperative social networks, noncooperative social networks, and multiple social networks;" for each class, this paper reviews the existing studies and discusses the challenge issues and possible future research directions.

To address this challenge, we propose vGASA, a virtualized GPU resource adaptive scheduling algorithm in cloud gaming. vGASA interposes scheduling algorithms in the graphics API of the operating system, and hence the host graphic driver or the guest operating system remains unmodified. To fulfill the service level agreement as well as maximize GPU usage, we propose three adaptive scheduling algorithms featuring feedback control that mitigates the impact of the runtime uncertainties on the system performance. The experimental results demonstrate that vGASA is able to maintain frames per second of various workloads at the desired level with the performance overhead limited to 5-12 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.288"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671583"",""GPU";resource management;scheduling;control theory;"cloud gaming"",""Graphics processing units";Games;Algorithm design and analysis;Virtualization;Runtime;Uncertainty;"Scheduling"","""",""36"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""20 Nov 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Norris has proved that if two nodes have the same view of depth n - 1, they have the same views for all depths. Taking the diameter d into account, we prove a new bound in O(d + d log(n/d)) instead of n - 1 for bidirectional graphs with port numbering, which are natural models in distributed computation. This automatically improves various results relying on Norris's bound.

A major challenge in network virtualization is the so-called virtual network embedding problem, which deals with the efficient embedding of virtual networks with resource constraints into a shared substrate network. A number of heuristics have been proposed to cope with the NP-hardness of this problem"; however, all of the existing proposals reserve fixed resources throughout the entire lifetime of a virtual network. In this paper, we re-examine this problem with the position that time-varying resource requirements of virtual networks should be taken into consideration, and we present an opportunistic resource sharing-based mapping framework, ORS, where substrate resources are opportunistically shared among multiple virtual networks. We formulate the time slot assignment as an optimization problem;" then, we prove the decision version of the problem to be NP-hard in the strong sense. Observing the resemblance between our problem and the bin packing problem, we adopt the core idea of first-fit and propose two practical solutions: first-fit by collision probability (CFF) and first-fit by expectation of indicators' sum (EFF). Simulation results show that ORS provides a more efficient utilization of substrate resources than two state-of-the-art fixed-resource embedding schemes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.64"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471977"",""Virtual network embedding";opportunistic resource sharing;NP-hard;3-partition;"bin packing"",""Substrates";Bandwidth;Resource management;Indexes;Indium phosphide;Virtualization;"Internet"","""",""89"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""7 Mar 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

We address this challenge with VMThunder, a new VM provisioning tool, which downloads data blockson demandduring the VM booting process and speeds up VM image streaming by strategically integrating peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming techniques with enhanced optimization schemes such as transfer on demand, cache on read, snapshot on local, and relay on cache. In particular, VMThunder stores the original images in a share storage and in the meantime it adopts a tree-based P2P streaming scheme so that common image blocks are cached and reused across the nodes in the cluster. We implement VMThunder in CentOS Linux and thoroughly test its performance.

Web services have been widely employed for building service-oriented applications in both industry and academia in recent years. The number of publicly available Web services is steadily increasing on the Internet. However, this proliferation makes it hard for a user to select a proper Web service among a large amount of service candidates. An inappropriate service selection may cause many problems (e.g., ill-suited performance) to the resulting applications. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering-based Web service recommender system to help users select services with optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS) performance. Our recommender system employs the location information and QoS values to cluster users and services, and makes personalized service recommendation for users based on the clustering results. Compared with existing service recommendation methods, our approach achieves considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy. Comprehensive experiments are conducted involving more than 1.5 million QoS records of real-world Web services to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.308"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684151"",""Web service";quality of service (QoS);recommendation;"collaborative filtering"",""Web services";Quality of service;Time factors;Prediction algorithms;Recommender systems;Algorithm design and analysis;"Collaboration"","""",""153"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""13 Dec 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When unlicensed users opportunistically utilize spectrum holes, prediction models that infer the availability of spectrum holes can help to improve the spectrum extraction rate and reduce the collision rate. In this paper, a spectrum occupancy prediction model based on Partial Periodic Pattern Mining (PPPM) is introduced. The mining aims at identifying frequent spectrum occupancy patterns that are hidden in the spectrum usage of a channel. The mined frequent patterns are then used to predict future channel states (i.e., busy or idle). Based on the prediction, unlicensed users are able to utilize spectrum holes aggressively without introducing significant interference to licensed users. PPPM outperforms traditional Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) by considering real patterns that do not repeat perfectly due to noise, sensing errors, and irregular behaviors. Using real-world Wi-Fi and personal communication service (PCS) activities, we show a significant reduction on miss rate in channel state prediction. With the proposed prediction mechanism, the performance of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is substantially improved. Further, we extend the three-state PPPM to an N-state PPPM to predict the duration of high/low utilization in a channel. The frequent patterns of channel utilization duration are critical in optimizing channel switch strategies. The high prediction accuracy is validated with data collected in the paging bands."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.283"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658755"",""Cognitive radio";dynamic spectrum access (DSA);spectrum occupancy prediction;"partial periodic pattern mining"",""Time series analysis";Hidden Markov models;Autoregressive processes;Entropy;Indexes;Sensors;"Data mining"","""",""36"",""1"",""32"",""IEEE"",""8 Nov 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Consequently, incorporation of fixed-policy Transactional Memory (TM) in general purpose computing systems is suboptimal by design and renders such systems susceptible to pathologies. Of particular concern are Hardware TM (HTM) systems where traditional designs have hardwired policies in silicon. Adaptive HTMs hold promise, but pose major challenges in terms of design and verification costs. In this paper, we present the ZEBRA HTM design, which lays down a simple yet high-performance approach to implement adaptive contention management in hardware. Prior work in this area has associated contention with transactional code blocks. However, we discover that by associating contention with data (cache blocks) accessed by transactional code rather than the code block itself, we achieve a neat match in granularity with that of the cache coherence protocol. This leads to a design that is very simple and yet able to track closely or exceed the performance of the best performing policy for a given workload. ZEBRA, therefore, brings together the inherent benefits of traditional eager HTMs-parallel commits-and lazy HTMs-good optimistic concurrency without deadlock avoidance mechanisms-, combining them into a low-complexity design."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2013.262"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6627888"",""Multicore architectures";transactional memory;parallel programming;"cache coherence protocols"",""Protocols";Coherence;Complexity theory;Parallel processing;Proposals;Hardware;"Concurrent computing"","""",""3"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""10 Oct 2013"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
