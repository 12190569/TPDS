After analyzing the existing data protection technologies, we propose a new disk array architecture that provides Timely Recovery to Any Point-in-time, referred to as TRAP. TRAP stores not only the data stripe upon a write to the array but also the time-stamped Exclusive ors (xors) of successive writes to each data block. By leveraging the xor operations that are performed upon each block write in today's RAID4/5 controllers, TRAP does not incur noticeable performance overhead. More importantly, TRAP is able to recover data very quickly to any point-in-time upon data damage by tracing back the sequence and history of xors resulting from writes. What is interesting is that the TRAP architecture is very space efficient. We have implemented a prototype of the new TRAP architecture using software at the block level and carried out extensive performance measurements using TPC-C benchmarks running on Oracle and Postgres databases, TPC-W running on a MySQL database, and file system benchmarks running on Linux and Windows systems. Our experiments demonstrated that TRAP not only is able to recover data to any point-in-time very quickly upon a failure but also uses less storage space than traditional daily incremental backup/snapshot. Compared to the state-of-the-art CDP technologies, TRAP saves disk storage space by one to two orders of magnitude with a simple and a fast encoding algorithm. In addition, TRAP can provide two-way data recovery with the availability of only one reference image in contrast to the one-way recovery of snapshot and incremental backup technologies."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.154"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604661"",""Disk array";disk I/O;data storage;data protection and recovery;data backup.;Disk Array;Disk I/O;Data Storage;"Data Protection and Recovery"",""Protection";Space technology;Computer architecture;Databases;Memory;Data analysis;History;Software prototyping;Software performance;"Measurement"","""",""12"",""16"",""67"",""IEEE"",""22 Aug 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That is, an IP address represents not only the location but also the identity of a host. To address this problem, several recent schemes propose to replace the IP namespace in today's Internet with a locator namespace and an identity namespace. The locator namespace consists of locators that are used to represent the locations of hosts. On the other hand, the identity namespace consists of identifiers that are used to represent the identities of hosts. For these schemes to work, there must be a mapping system that can supply an appropriate locator for any given end point identifier (EID). While prior related works mainly focus on aggregable EIDs, several recent works proposed the use of self-certifying EIDs for purpose of security and privacy. However, self-certifying EIDs are flat, unstructured and prior proposals cannot be used to deal with flat EIDs. In this paper, we propose a Distributed hash table (DHT)-based identifier-to-locator mapping scheme to resolve a locator for a flat identifier. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. We show that, besides the capability to support flat EIDs, the scheme has good scalability and low resolution delay.

Commonly utilized techniques for providing fault tolerance in distributed systems are periodic job checkpointing and replication. While very robust, both techniques can delay job execution if inappropriate checkpointing intervals and replica numbers are chosen. This paper introduces several heuristics that dynamically adapt the above mentioned parameters based on information on grid status to provide high job throughput in the presence of failure while reducing the system overhead. Furthermore, a novel fault-tolerant algorithm combining checkpointing and replication is presented.

In our design, each bulk transfer job request, which can be made in advance to the central network controller, specifies a start time and an end time. If admitted, the network guarantees to complete the transfer before the end time. However, there is flexibility in how the actual transfer is carried out, that is, in the bandwidth assignment on each allowed path of the job on each time interval, and it is up to the scheduling algorithm to decide this. To improve the network resource utilization or lower the job rejection ratio, the network controller solves optimization problems in making AC and scheduling decisions. Our design combines the following elements into a cohesive optimization-based framework: advance reservations, multipath routing, and bandwidth reassignment via periodic reoptimization.

Researchers have addressed data centers' performance-per-watt management at different hierarchies going from server clusters to servers to individual components within the server platform. This paper addresses performance-per-watt maximization of memory subsystems in a data center. Traditional memory power management techniques rely on profiling the utilization of memory modules and transitioning them to some low-power mode when they are sufficiently idle. However, fully interleaved memory presents an interesting research challenge because data striping across memory modules reduces the idleness of individual modules to warrant transitions to low-power states. In this paper, we present a novel technique for performance-per-watt maximization of interleaved memory by dynamically reconfiguring (expanding or contracting) the degree of interleaving to adapt to incoming workload. The reconfigured memory hosts the application's working set on a smaller set of modules in a manner that exploits the platform's memory hierarchy architecture. This creates the opportunity for the remaining memory modules to transition to low-power states and remain in those states for as long as the performance remains within given acceptable thresholds. The memory power expenditure is minimized subject to application memory requirements and end-to-end memory access delay constraints. This is formulated as a performance-per-watt maximization problem and solved using an analytical memory power and performance model. Our technique has been validated on a real server using SPECjbb benchmark and on a trace-driven memory simulator using SPECjbb and gcc memory traces. On the server, our techniques are shown to give about 48.8 percent (26.7 kJ) energy savings compared to traditional techniques measured at 4.5 percent. The maximum improvement in performance-per-watt was measured at 88.48 percent. The simulator showed 89.7 percent improvement in performance-per-watt compared to the best performing traditional technique."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.136"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4585375"",""Application-aware adaptation";energy-aware systems;interleaved memory;modeling and prediction;optimization.;Interleaved memories;"Energy-aware systems"",""Interleaved codes";Memory management;Random access memory;Energy management;Energy consumption;Runtime;Computer Society;Memory architecture;Delay;"Performance analysis"","""",""10"","""",""20"",""IEEE"",""1 Aug 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of DDM is to reduce and control the volume of information exchanged among the simulated entities (federates) in a large-scale distributed simulation system. In order to fulfill its goal, a considerable amount of DDM messages needs to be exchanged within the simulation (federation). The question of whether each message should be sent immediately after it is generated or held until it can be grouped with other DDM messages needs to be investigated further. Our experimental results have shown that the total DDM time of a simulation varies considerably depending on which transmission strategy is used. Moreover, in the case of grouping, the DDM time depends on the size of the group. In this paper, we propose a novel DDM approach, which we refer to as Adaptive Grid-based (AGB) DDM. The AGB protocol is distinct from all existing DDM implementations, because it is able to predict the average amount of data generated in each time step of a simulation. Therefore, the AGB DDM approach controls a simulation running in the most appropriate mode to achieve a desired performance. This new DDM approach consists of two adaptive control parts: 1) the Adaptive Resource Allocation Control (ARAC) scheme and 2) the Adaptive Transmission Control (ATC) scheme. The focus of this paper is on the ATC scheme. We describe how to build a switching model to predict the average amount of DDM messages generated and how the ATC scheme uses this estimation result to optimize the overall DDM time. Our experimental results provide a clear evidence that the ATC scheme is able to achieve the best performance in DDM time when compared to all existing DDM protocols using an extensive set of experimental case studies."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.54"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4487063"",""Data distribution management";adaptive transmission control;adaptive grid-based approach;large-scale distributed simulation;grid-based DDM protocols;publish/subscribe model.;Data Distribution Management;Adaptive Transmission Control Scheme;Adaptive Grid-based DDM;Large-scale Distributed Simulation;Grid-based DDM protocols;"Publish/subscribe model"",""Programmable control";Adaptive control;Large-scale systems;Distributed decision making;Protocols;Predictive models;Grid computing;Matched filters;Mathematical model;"Control system synthesis"","""",""1"","""",""24"",""IEEE"",""11 Apr 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable quasi-aggregate signature scheme, CLFSR, based on third-order linear feedback shift register (cubic LFSR) sequences that can be instantiated using both XTR and GH public key cryptosystems.

Due to the resource limitations of WSNs, it is challenging to implement in-network querying in a distributed, lightweight, resilient, and energy-efficient manner. We address these challenges by exploiting location information and the geometry of the network and propose an in-network querying framework, namely, the Distributed Quad-Tree (DQT). DQT is distance sensitive for querying of an event: the cost of answering a query for an event is at most a constant factor (2radic(2) in our case) of the distance *d* to the event. DQT construction is local and does not require any communication. Moreover, due to its minimalist infrastructure and stateless nature, DQT shows graceful resilience to node failures and topology changes. Since event-based querying is inherently limited to the anticipated types of inquiries, we further extend our framework to achieve complex range-based querying. To this end, we use a multiresolution algorithm, which is optimal with respect to least square errors that models the data in a decentralized way. Our model-based scheme answers queries with approximate values accompanied by certainty levels with increased resolution at lower layers of the DQT hierarchy. Our analysis and experiments show that our framework achieves distance sensitivity and resiliency for event-based querying, as well as greatly reduces the cost of complex range querying."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.217"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641913"",""Distributed Quad-Tree";distance-sensitive in-network querying;multiresolution modeling;wireless sensor networks.;Ubiquitous computing;"Wireless sensor networks"",""Wireless sensor networks";Costs;Information processing;Energy efficiency;Information geometry;Resilience;Topology;Energy resolution;Least squares methods;"Least squares approximation"","""",""31"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""10 Oct 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In other words, our algorithm determines the set of tasks that should be run concurrently and the number of processors to be allocated to each task. The processor allocation and scheduling decisions are made in an integrated manner and are based on several factors such as the structure of the task graph, the runtime estimates and scalability characteristics of the tasks, and the intertask data communication volumes. A locality-conscious scheduling strategy is used to improve intertask data reuse. Evaluation through simulations and actual executions of task graphs derived from real applications and synthetic graphs shows that our algorithm consistently generates schedules with a lower makespan as compared to Critical Path Reduction (CPR) and Critical Path and Allocation (CPA), two previously proposed scheduling algorithms. Our algorithm also produces schedules that have a lower makespan than pure task- and data-parallel schedules.

In this paper, we study a new class of attacks, the invisible LOCalization (iLOC) attack. The iLOC attack can accurately and invisibly localize monitors of ITM systems. In the iLOC attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected pseudonoise code (PN-code), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PN-code is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We formally analyze the impact of various parameters on attack effectiveness. We implement the iLOC attack and conduct the performance evaluation on a real-world ITM system to demonstrate the possibility of such attacks. We also conduct extensive simulations on the iLOC attack using real-world traces. Our data show that the iLOC attack can accurately identify monitors while being invisible to ITM systems.

We formulate the energy consumption balancing problem as an optimal transmitting data distribution problem by combining the ideas of corona-based network division and mixed-routing strategy together with data aggregation. We first propose a localized zone-based routing scheme that guarantees balanced energy consumption among nodes within each corona. We then design an offline centralized algorithm with time complexity O(n) (n is the number of coronas) to solve the transmitting data distribution problem aimed at balancing energy consumption among nodes in different coronas. The approach for computing the optimal number of coronas in terms of maximizing network lifetime is also presented.

However, it is commonly understood that it is difficult to construct a short route in an SW network, given source (s) and target (t) nodes, though an SW network guarantees that a short route from s to t exists. Prior work in [1] proposed a navigable SW network for a d-dimensional lattice such that a simple localized routing algorithm can be devised to route a message from s to t using O(log2,X) hops, where X is the number of nodes in the network.

In general, the selection of the supernode transformation greatly affects the parallel execution time of the transformed algorithm. Since the minimization of the overall parallel execution time via an appropriate supernode transformation is very difficult to accomplish, researchers have focused on scheduling-aware supernode transformations that maximize parallelism during the execution. In this paper we argue that the communication volume of the transformed algorithm is an important criterion, and its minimization should be given high priority. For this reason we define the metric of the per process communication volume and propose a method to minimize this metric by selecting a communication-aware supernode shape. Our approach is equivalent to defining a proper Cartesian process grid with MPI_Cart_Create, which means that it can be incorporated in applications in a straightforward manner. Our experimental results illustrate that by selecting the tile shape with the proposed method, the total parallel execution time is significantly reduced due to the minimization of the communication volume, despite the fact that a few more parallel execution steps are required."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.114"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553708"",""I/O and Data Communications";Load balancing and task assignment;Parallel processors;Parallel Architectures;Scheduling and task partitioning;Data communications;I/O and Data Communications;Load balancing and task assignment;Parallel processors;Parallel Architectures;Scheduling and task partitioning;"Data communications"",""Parallel processing";Minimization methods;Delay;Bibliographies;Processor scheduling;Computer architecture;Image processing;"Computational modeling"","""",""5"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""27 Jun 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SC preserves the schedule length of the original schedule and reduces processor count by merging processor schedules and removing redundant duplicate tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to address this highly unexplored aspect of DAG scheduling. On average, SC reduced the processor requirement 91, 82, and 72 percent for schedules generated by PLW, TCSD, and CPFD algorithms, respectively. SC algorithm has a low complexity (O(\vert {\cal N}\vert^3)) compared to most duplication-based algorithms. Moreover, it decouples processor economization from schedule length minimization problem. To take advantage of these features of SC, we also propose a scheduling algorithm SDS, having the same time complexity as SC. Our experiments demonstrate that schedules generated by SDS are only 3 percent longer than CPFD (O(\vert {\cal N}\vert^4)), one of the best algorithms in that respect.

The framework includes a flexible and powerful communication pattern representation scheme that captures the property of communication patterns and allows manipulation of these patterns. In this way, communication phases can be identified within the application. Additionally, we extend the classification of static and dynamic communications to include persistent communications. Persistent communications are a subclass of dynamic communications that remain unchanged for large segments of the application execution. An experimental compiler has been developed to implement the framework. This compiler is capable of detecting both static and persistent communications within an application. We show that for the NAS Parallel Benchmarks, 100% of the point-to-point communications can be classified as either static or persistent and 100% of the collectives are either static or persistent with the exception of IS.

Obviously, the capacity of a software agent to execute tasks is determined by not only itself but also its contextual agents"; thus, the number of tasks allocated on an agent should be directly proportional to its self-owned resources as well as its contextual agents' resources. This paper presents a novel task allocation model based on the contextual resource negotiation. In the presented task allocation model, while a task comes to the software system, it is first assigned to a principal agent that has high contextual enrichment factor for the required resources; then, the principal agent will negotiate with its contextual agents to execute the assigned task. However, while multiple tasks come to the software system, it is necessary to make load balancing to avoid overconvergence of tasks at certain agents that are rich of contextual resources. Thus, this paper also presents a novel load balancing method: if there are overlarge number of tasks queued for a certain agent, the capacities of both the agent itself and its contextual agents to accept new tasks will be reduced. Therefore, in this paper, the task allocation and load balancing are implemented according to the contextual resource distribution of agents, which can be well suited for the characteristics of complex software systems;" and the presented model can reduce more communication costs between allocated agents than the previous methods based on self-owned resource distribution of agents."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.133"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4585372"",""Complex software systems";multiagents;contextual resource;negotiation;task allocation;load balancing.;Load balancing and task assignment;"Organizational management and coordination"",""Resource management";Load management;Software systems;Software agents;Context modeling;Costs;"Software development management"","""",""44"",""2"",""28"",""IEEE"",""1 Aug 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we focus on percolation in coverage and connectivity in 3D WSNs. We say that the network exhibits a coverage percolation (respectively, connectivity percolation) when a giant covered region (respectively, giant connected component) almost surely spans the entire network for the first time. Because of the dependency between coverage and connectivity, the problem is not only a continuum percolation problem but also an integrated continuum percolation problem. Thus, we propose an integrated-concentric-sphere model to address coverage and connectivity in 3D WSNs in an integrated way.

In particular, we are concerned with a simple yet effective attack in which a router selectively drops packets destined for some victim. Unfortunately, it is quite challenging to attribute a missing packet to a malicious action because normal network congestion can produce the same effect. Modern networks routinely drop packets when the load temporarily exceeds their buffering capacities. Previous detection protocols have tried to address this problem with a user-defined threshold: too many dropped packets imply malicious intent. However, this heuristic is fundamentally unsound";" setting this threshold is, at best, an art and will certainly create unnecessary false positives or mask highly focused attacks. We have designed, developed, and implemented a compromised router detection protocol that dynamically infers, based on measured traffic rates and buffer sizes, the number of congestive packet losses that will occur.

The strong version requires that each node discovers the topology regardless of faults. We focus on non-cryptographic solutions to these problems. We explore their bounds. We prove that the weak topology discovery problem is solvable only if the connectivity of the network exceeds the number of faults in the system. Similarly, we show that the strong version of the problem is solvable only if the network connectivity is more than twice the number of faults. We present solutions to both versions of the problem. The presented algorithms match the established graph connectivity bounds. The algorithms do not require the individual nodes to know either the diameter or the size of the network.

Motivated by these considerations, we design and analyze a class of simple and local distributed algorithms called Nearest Neighbor Tree (NNT) algorithms for energy-efficient construction of MSTs in a wireless ad hoc setting. We assume that the nodes are uniformly distributed in a unit square and show provable bounds on the performance with respect to both the quality of the spanning tree produced and the energy needed to construct them.

The two main techniques that are most suitable to cope with the dynamic nature of the grid are dynamic load balancing (DLB) and job replication (JR). In this paper, we analyze and compare the effectiveness of these two approaches by means of trace-driven simulations. We observe that there exists an easy-to-measure statistic Y and a corresponding threshold value Y*, such that DLB consistently outperforms JR when Y > Y*, whereas the reverse is true for Y < Y*. Based on this observation, we propose a simple and easy-to-implement approach, throughout referred to as the DLB/JR method, that can make dynamic decisions about whether to use DLB or JR.

It only generates a fixed amount of query messages at each hop but would take longer search time. We propose the dynamic search (DS) algorithm, which is a generalization of flooding and RW. DS takes advantage of various contexts under which each previous search algorithm performs well. It resembles flooding for short-term search and RW for long-term search. Moreover, DS could be further combined with knowledge-based search mechanisms to improve the search performance. We analyze the performance of DS based on some performance metrics including the success rate, search time, query hits, query messages, query efficiency, and search efficiency.

To answer this question, we analyze a 1,356-million-packet trace from a large commercial massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called ShenZhou Online. We show that both network delay and network loss significantly affect a player's decision to leave a game prematurely. It is feasible to predict whether players will quit prematurely based on the network conditions they experience. The proposed model can determine the relative impact of different types of network impairment. For our traces, the degrees of player intolerance to network delay, delay jitter, client packet loss, and server packet loss are in the proportion of 1:2:4:3 approximately. The model can also be used to make system design decisions. Through simulations, we show that by prioritizing server processing according to the goodness of network conditions, employing dejitter buffers, or replacing TCP with a more lightweight transport protocol, the probability of premature departure can be significantly reduced.

It is needed to securely cope with dynamic membership and topology as well as to bootstrap other important security primitives (such as key management) and services (such as secure routing) without the assistance of any centralized trusted authority. An ideal admission technique must involve minimal interaction among MANET nodes, since connectivity can be unstable. Also, since MANETs are often composed of weak or resource-limited devices, admission must be efficient in terms of computation and communication. Most previously proposed admission protocols are prohibitively expensive and require heavy interaction among MANET nodes. In this paper, we focus on a common type of MANET that is formed on a temporary basis, and present a secure, efficient, and a fully noninteractive admission technique geared for this type of a network.

We show that known cost allocation schemes are not sufficient. We provide a shadow-price-based cost allocation for networks without capacity limits and show that it enforces minimum-cost multicast. This improves previous result where a 2-approximate multicast flow is enforced. For capacitated networks, computing cost allocation by ignoring edge capacities will not yield correct results. We show that an edge tax scheme can be combined with a cost allocation to strictly enforce optimal multicast flows in this more realistic case. If taxes are not desirable, they can be returned to flows while maintaining weak enforcement of the optimal flow.

However, such devices often have limited resources in terms of CPU, storage, battery power, and communication bandwidth. Thus, there is a need to transfer ubiquitous computing application services to more powerful computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the use of the grid as a candidate for provisioning computational services to applications in ubiquitous computing environments.

The competition takes place in terms of quality of service (QoS) and cost offered by different grid service providers (GSPs).

A two-layer hierarchy is imposed on the network by grouping mobile hosts into clusters, each with a clusterhead. The messages from and to the hosts in the same cluster are merged/unmerged by the clusterhead so as to reduce the message cost and improve the scalability. The proposed modular approach separates the concerns of clustering hosts from achieving consensus. A clustering function, called eventual clusterer (denoted as diamC), is designed for constructing and maintaining the two-layer hierarchy. Similar to unreliable failure detectors, diamC greatly facilitates the design of hierarchical protocols by providing the fault-tolerant clustering function transparently. We propose an implementation of diamC based on the failure detector diamS. Using diamC, we design a new hierarchical consensus protocol. As shown by the performance evaluation results, the proposed consensus protocol can save both message cost and time cost.

The function of a firewall is to examine each incoming and outgoing packet and decide whether to accept or to discard the packet based on its policy. Due to the lack of tools for analyzing firewall policies, most firewalls on the Internet have been plagued with policy errors. A firewall policy error either creates security holes that will allow malicious traffic to sneak into a private network or blocks legitimate traffic and disrupts normal business processes, which in turn could lead to irreparable, if not tragic, consequences. Because a firewall may have a large number of rules and the rules often conflict, understanding and analyzing the function of a firewall has been known to be notoriously difficult. An effective way to assist firewall administrators to understand and analyze the function of their firewalls is by issuing queries. An example of a firewall query is """"Which computers in the private network can receive packets from a known malicious host in the outside Internet?rdquo Two problems need to be solved in order to make firewall queries practically useful: how to describe a firewall query and how to process a firewall query. In this paper, we first introduce a simple and effective SQL-like query language, called the Structured Firewall Query Language (SFQL), for describing firewall queries. Second, we give a theorem, called the Firewall Query Theorem, as the foundation for developing firewall query processing algorithms.

Unlike other previous proposals, it does not require additional network hardware, and its memory requirements, switch hardware, and routing delay scales up with the network size. Indeed, it nullifies only the strictly necessary paths, allowing adaptive routing through the healthy paths. The methodology is based on enhancing the interval routing scheme with exclusion intervals. Exclusion intervals are associated to each switch output port and represent the nodes that are unreachable from this port after a fault. We propose a methodology to identify the links where the exclusion intervals must be updated after a fault, the values to write on them, and a very efficient mechanism to distribute the required information through the network without stopping the system activity.

As a consequence, lookups have high latency as each lookup requires contacting several nodes in sequence. In this paper, we question these assumptions by presenting a peer-to-peer routing algorithm with small lookup paths. Our algorithm, called ldquoOneHop,rdquo maintains full information about the system membership at each node, routing in a single hop whenever that information is up to date and in a small number of hops otherwise.

We apply history-sensitive heuristics to measure the path complexity and assess the chaining efficiency. We discover successive edges of a trust chain, adaptively, to match with the demands from various P2P applications.

In this paper, we propose novel methods that avoid routing hotspots proactively, that is, prior to a congestion event. More specifically, we define an incentive-compatible pricing vector explicitly and show that the hotspot can be avoided if all nodes in the network follow the incentive-compatible pricing policy.

Some joint routing and channel assignment algorithms are also designed to increase the network throughput based on the premise that we can switch between different channels freely. Although simulations show that great improvements on network throughput can be observed in both cases, two fundamental questions remain: 1) Can we really use multiple nonoverlapping channels freely in WMNs? 2) If we can, what will be the cost when we switch channels dynamically and frequently? In this paper, by conducting extensive experiments on our testbed, we attempt to answer these questions. We find that in spite of interference between both overlapping and nonoverlapping channels, we can still use multiple channels in mesh networks under certain conditions but with care.

Because of the bandwidth constraint, the observations are quantized before being transmitted. Three kinds of sensor network topologies (cluster-based sensor network, sensor network with a fusion center, and concatenated sensor network) are considered in order to show the impact of topology on the performance and energy efficiency. The mixtures are reconstructed based on the received quantized data, and source extraction is performed by using a fast fixed-point algorithm with prewhitening. This algorithm was proposed by Hyvarinen and Oja, published in Neural Computation, and has the advantage of simplicity and fast convergence. The case of source extraction where the sensed data are undistorted is used as the performance benchmark. The results show that in all these sensor networks, the performance can be close to that of the benchmarking case.

Worse still, the emerging multi/many-core architectures with small on-chip memory make these issues more challenging. In this paper, we address the challenges of exploiting the fine grain parallelism and locality of NPDP on multicore architectures. We describe a latency-tolerant model and a percolation technique for programming on multicore architectures. On an algorithmic level, both parallelism and locality do benefit from a specific data dependence transformation of NPDP. Next, we propose a parallel pipelining algorithm by decomposing computation operators and percolating data through a memory hierarchy to create just-in-time locality. In order to predict the execution time, we formulate an analytical performance model of the parallel algorithm.

This approach permits the acquisition of node IDs to be tightly regulated without many of the complexities and costs associated with traditional certificate solutions.

Topological characteristics have profound impact on the efficiency of a search on such unstructured P2P networks, as well as other networks. A key limitation of scale-free (power-law) topologies is the high load (i.e., high degree) on a very few number of hub nodes. In a typical unstructured P2P network, peers are not willing to maintain high degrees/loads as they may not want to store a large number of entries for construction of the overlay topology. Therefore, to achieve fairness and practicality among all peers, hard cutoffs on the number of entries are imposed by the individual peers, which limits scale-freeness of the overall topology, hence limited scale-free networks. Thus, it is expected that the efficiency of the flooding search reduces as the size of the hard cutoff does. We investigate the construction of scale-free topologies with hard cutoffs (i.e., there are not any major hubs) and the effect of these hard cutoffs on the search efficiency.

They use cryptographic techniques to maintain file confidentiality and integrity from malicious nodes. Unfortunately, cryptographic techniques cannot protect a file holder from a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or a host compromise attack. Hence, most of these distributed file systems are vulnerable to targeted file attacks, wherein an adversary attempts to attack a small (chosen) set of files by attacking the nodes that host them. This paper presents LocationGuard - a location hiding technique for securing overlay file storage systems from targeted file attacks. LocationGuard has three essential components: (i) location key, (ii) routing guard, a secure algorithm that protects accesses to a file in the overlay network given its location key, and (iii) a set of location inference guards.

In most scenarios, actors have to respond collectively, which requires interactor coordination. Therefore, maintaining a connected interactor network is critical to the effectiveness of WSANs. However, WSANs often operate unattended in harsh environments where actors can easily fail or get damaged. An actor failure may lead to partitioning the interactor network and thus hinder the fulfillment of the application requirements.

A node's service profile consists of a set of services (i.e., sensing and actuation capabilities) that it provides and the quality-of-service (QoS) parameters associated with those services (delay, accuracy, freshness, etc.). muRACER uses an efficient service-aware routing approach that aggressively reduces downstream traffic (from the sink to the network's nodes) by translating service profiles into efficient paths for queries. To support QoS, muRACER dynamically adapts each node's routing behavior and service profile according to the current context of that node, i.e., number of pending queries and number and type of messages to be routed. Finally, muRACER improves end-to-end reliability through a scalable reputation-based approach in which each node is able to locally estimate the next hop of the most reliable path to the sink. Service- and context-aware reliable routing enhances the network's efficiency and effectiveness (satisfaction of applications' QoS requirements).

In existing approaches, peers are assigned with a fixed number of parents without regard to their contributions, measured by the amount of outgoing bandwidths. Obviously, this is an undesirable arrangement as it leads to highly inefficient use of the P2P links.

We argue that these simulations suffer from severe limitations that lead to suboptimal scheduler designs and to even dismissing potentially good design alternatives. We propose an alternative simulation methodology called site-level simulation, in which the workload for the evaluation is generated dynamically by user models that interact with the system.

Nevertheless, designing protocols that provide the processes with good approximations of the set of processes that are currently alive remains a real challenge in fault-tolerant-distributed computing. This paper proposes such a protocol, plus a second protocol that allows to cope with heterogeneous communication networks. These protocols consider a realistic computation model where the processes are provided with nonsynchronized local clocks and a function \alpha () that takes a local duration \Delta as a parameter, and returns an integer that is an estimate of the number of processes that could have crashed during that duration \Delta.

The design of integrated schedulers in CICQ switches has thus far been neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel CICQ architecture that supports both unicast and multicast traffic along with its appropriate scheduling. In particular, we propose an integrated round-robin-based scheduler that efficiently services both unicast and multicast traffic simultaneously.

Thus, an optical bus is formed, allowing traffic multiplexing without the state change of any optical shutter. This, however, limits the system throughput and also makes it impossible to implement a fully distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol to assure quality of service (QoS) in a light-trail.

Due to the tight constraints on its physical size, the IW faces more severe pressure to handle the instructions from various threads while attempting to avoid resource monopolization by some low-ILP threads. It is particularly challenging to optimize the efficiency and fairness in IW utilization to fulfill the affordable performance by SMT under the shadow of long latency instructions. Most of the existing optimization schemes in SMT processors rely on the fetch policy to control the instructions that are allowed to enter the pipeline, while little effort is put to control the long latency instructions that are already located in the IW. In this paper, we propose streamline buffers to handle the long latency instructions that have already entered the pipeline and clog the IW, while the controlling fetch policies take time to react. Each streamline buffer extracts from IW and holds a chain of instructions from a thread that are stalled by dependency on a long latency load. When the load value returns, the streamline buffer then serves these instructions directly to in-order execution, avoiding any instruction replay. This is done in supplement to the conventional IW that serves in parallel the other instructions for out-of-order (o-o-o) execution. Analysis of SPEC2000 integer and FP benchmarks reveals that instructions dependent on long latency loads, typically have their first source operand ready within 5 percent-15 percent of their total wait time in the IW. Our scheme is able to utilize this asymmetry in source operands' ready time to achieve a complexity effective design. As compared to the baseline SMT architecture, our design when working in conjunction with earlier proposed ICOUNT.2.8 fetch policy for 4-threads effectively reduces the IW full rate by 9.4 percent (11 percent for 2-thread), improves average IPC for MIXED workloads by 9.6 percent (8 percent for MEM workloads and 4.4 percent for CPU workloads), and fairness by 7.56 percent (7.24 percent for 2-thread). Similar enhancements are observed when run in conjunction with an RR.2.8 fetch policy. Further, our scheme when combined with DCRA improves the performance on the average by 21.7 percent, while DCRA improves by 16.3 percent when run alone."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.97"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4538215"",""Multithreaded processors";Speculative multi-threading;Support for multi-threaded execution;Multithreaded processors;Speculative multi-threading;"Support for multi-threaded execution"",""Processor scheduling";Surface-mount technology;Delay;Pipelines;Multithreading;Resource management;Out of order;"Registers"","""",""4"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""6 Jun 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditionally, clustering algorithms aim at generating a number of disjoint clusters that satisfy some criteria. In this paper, we formulate a novel clustering problem that aims at generating overlapping multihop clusters. Overlapping clusters are useful in many sensor network applications, including intercluster routing, node localization, and time synchronization protocols. We also propose a randomized, distributed multihop clustering algorithm (KOCA) for solving the overlapping clustering problem. KOCA aims at generating connected overlapping clusters that cover the entire sensor network with a specific average overlapping degree.

There is considerable recent interest in using the Cell Broadband Engine, a heterogeneous multicore chip that provides high performance, for biological applications. However, work in genomic alignments so far has been limited to computing optimal alignment scores using quadratic space for the basic global/local alignment problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of developing alignment algorithms on the Cell, exploiting its thread and data level parallelism features. First, we develop a parallel implementation on the Cell that computes optimal alignments and adopts Hirschberg's linear space technique. The former is essential, as merely computing optimal alignment scores is not useful, while the latter is needed to permit alignments of longer sequences. We then present Cell implementations of two advanced alignment techniques-spliced alignments and syntenic alignments. Spliced alignments are useful in aligning mRNA sequences with corresponding genomic sequences to uncover the gene structure. Syntenic alignments are used to discover conserved exons and other sequences between long genomic sequences from different organisms. We present experimental results for these three types of alignments on 16 Synergistic Processing Elements of the IBM QS20 dual-Cell blade system."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.254"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721368"",""Parallel algorithms";biology and genetics;"pattern matching."",""Genomics";Bioinformatics;Engines;Sequences;Organisms;Computational biology;Cells (biology);Multicore processing;"Biology computing"","""",""19"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""22 Dec 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Loosely coupled processors have an advantage in that resources such as processor and L1 cache resources are not contended by the application and helper threads, hence preserving the speed of the application. However, interprocessor communication is expensive in such a system. We present techniques to alleviate this. Our approach exploits large loop-based code regions and is based on a new synchronization mechanism between the application and helper threads. This mechanism precisely controls how far ahead the execution of the helper thread can be with respect to the application thread. We found that this is important in ensuring prefetching timeliness and avoiding cache pollution. To demonstrate that prefetching in a loosely coupled system can be done effectively, we evaluate our prefetching by simulating a standard unmodified CMP system and an intelligent memory system where a simple processor in memory executes the helper thread. Evaluating our scheme with nine memory-intensive applications with the memory processor in DRAM achieves an average speedup of 1.25. Moreover, our scheme works well in combination with a conventional processor-side sequential L1 prefetcher, resulting in an average speedup of 1.31. In a standard CMP, the scheme achieves an average speedup of 1.33. Using a real CMP system with a shared L2 cache between two cores, our helper thread prefetching plus hardware L2 prefetching achieves an average speedup of 1.15 over the hardware L2 prefetching for the subset of applications with high L2 cache misses per cycle."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.224"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641920"",""Helper thread";prefetching;chip multiprocessors;processing-in-memory system.;Cache memories;Multi-core/single-chip multiprocessors;"Concurrent Programming"",""Prefetching";Multiprocessing systems;Hardware;Intelligent systems;Surface-mount technology;Communication system control;Pollution;Random access memory;"Content management"","""",""22"",""11"",""37"",""IEEE"",""10 Oct 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose a framework, PReSENt, to promote and make more secure the practices of collaboration among nodes by securing a compensation to the collaboration. When the PReSENt is enabled in wireless mesh networks, a node accumulates credits, an amount quantifying its resource provision when it provides its resource for other nodes. The nodes consuming the resource publish rewards, an amount quantifying their resource usage. The credits are used to guarantee the resource sharing for the provider from the customers in the future, whose amount is proportional to its relative contribution to the network-wide collaboration. The rewards are used to validate their corresponding credits in order to prevent false accumulations of the credits in selfish nodes.

Second, the continuously evolving nature of spam demands the collaborative techniques to be resilient to various kinds of camouflage attacks. Third, the collaboration has to be lightweight, efficient, and scalable. Toward addressing these challenges, this paper presents ALPACAS-a privacy-aware framework for collaborative spam filtering.

Synergy enables efficient reuse of both result streams and processing components, while composing distributed stream processing applications with QoS demands. It provides a set of fully distributed algorithms to discover and evaluate the reusability of available result streams and processing components when instantiating new stream applications. Specifically, Synergy performs QoS impact projection to examine whether the shared processing can cause QoS violations on currently running applications. The QoS impact projection algorithm can handle different types of streams including both regular traffic and bursty traffic. If no existing processing components can be reused, Synergy dynamically deploys new components at strategic locations to satisfy new application requests.

Unfortunately, none of these methods can guarantee both scalability and delivery.

Scheduling these applications efficiently on parallel platforms has been a long-standing challenge. In the case of a single homogeneous platform, such as a cluster, results have been obtained both in theory, i.e., guaranteed algorithms, and, in practice, i.e., pragmatic heuristics. Due to task parallelism, these applications are well suited for execution on distributed platforms that span multiple clusters possibly in multiple institutions. However, the only available results in this context are nonguaranteed heuristics. In this paper, we develop a scheduling algorithm, MCGAS, which is applicable to multicluster platforms that are almost homogeneous. Such platforms are often found as large subsets of multicluster platforms. Our novel contribution is that MCGAS computes task allocations so that a (tunable) performance guarantee is provided. Since a performance guarantee does not necessarily imply good average performance in practice, we also compare MCGAS with a recently proposed nonguaranteed algorithm. Using simulation over a wide range of experimental scenarios, we find that MCGAS leads to better average application makespans than its competitor."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.11"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752814"",""Mixed parallelism";parallel task graph scheduling;performance guarantee;"multicluster platform."",""Parallel processing";Processor scheduling;Clustering algorithms;Scheduling algorithm;Computational modeling;Measurement;Concurrent computing;Scalability;Production;"Middleware"","""",""40"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""19 Jan 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we systematically address TCP performance issues of flow-based mix networks. A mix's batching and reordering schemes can dramatically reduce TCP throughput due to out-of-order packet delivery. We developed a theoretical model to analyze such impact and present formulas for approximate TCP throughput in mix networks. To improve TCP performance, we examined the approach of increasing TCP's duplicate threshold parameter and derived formulas for the performance gains. Our proposed approaches will not degrade the system anonymity degree since they do not change the underlying anonymity mechanism. Our data matched our theoretical analysis well.

In this paper, we present an interconnection structure that limits the number of messages needed for search queries. This structure, called distributed spanning tree (DST), defines each node as the root of a spanning tree. So, it behaves as a tree for the number of messages but it balances the load generated by the requests among computers, and thus, it avoids to overload the root node. This structure is scalable because it needs only a logarithmic memory space per computer to be maintained. A formal and practical description of the structure is presented and we describe traversal algorithms.

Finally, the algorithm stitches those patches to form a single global map. In a patch-and-stitch algorithm, the stitching order makes an influence on both the performance and the complexity of the algorithm. In this paper, we present a formal framework to deal with stitching orders in patch-and-stitch localization algorithms. In our framework, the stitching order is determined by a stitching scheme and the stitching scheme consists of a stitching policy and a potential function. The potential function is to predict how well a patch will be stitched if patches are stitched according to a given partial order. The stitching policy is a mechanism that determines the stitching order based on the predictions by the potential function. We present various stitching schemes and evaluate them through simulations. In addition, we apply the patch-and-stitch strategy into the anchor-based localization and propose a clustering-based localization algorithm. A potential function is used to partition the network into clusters each of which is centered at an anchor node. For each cluster, a cluster map is constructed via the anchor-free localization algorithm. Then, those cluster maps are combined to form a single global map.

However, the loosely coupled nature of this environment can make data access unpredictable, and in the limit, unavailable. We introduce the notion of accessibility to capture both availability and performance. An increasing number of data-intensive applications require not only considerations of node computation power but also accessibility for adequate job allocations. For instance, selecting a node with intolerably slow connections can offset any benefit to running on a fast node. In this paper, we present accessibility-aware resource selection techniques by which it is possible to choose nodes that will have efficient data access to remote data sources. We show that the local data access observations collected from a node's neighbors are sufficient to characterize accessibility for that node. By conducting trace-based, synthetic experiments on PlanetLab, we show that the resource selection heuristics guided by this principle significantly outperform conventional techniques such as latency-based or random allocations. The suggested techniques are also shown to be stable even under churn despite the loss of prior observations."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.13"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752816"",""Data Accessibility";resource selection;passive network performance estimation;data-intensive computing;"large-scale distributed systems."",""Large-scale systems";Peer to peer computing;Availability;Distributed computing;Throughput;Physics;Bioinformatics;Large Hadron Collider;Resource management;"Passive networks"","""",""9"","""",""51"",""IEEE"",""19 Jan 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The buffers are typically implemented using a combination of SRAM and DRAM technologies in order to simultaneously meet the routers' high speed and capacity requirements. The major challenge in designing router buffers is to maintain multiple flow queues in the memory, unlike computer memory buffers (i.e., memory system). The major objective is to minimize the use of expensive but fast SRAM while providing acceptable delay guarantees to packets. In this paper, we first investigate hybrid SRAM/DRAM solutions proposed in the past. We show that one of the architectural limitations of these solutions is that the required SRAM size grows linearly with the number of flows in the system. This prevents the solutions from scaling to support a large number of flows. We then break down this shortcoming by proposing a parallel hybrid SRAM/DRAM (PHSD) architecture. We design a series of memory management algorithms (MMAs) for PHSD, based on tradeoffs between the complexity of the MMAs and the guarantee of in-order delivery of packets (segmentations). We perform a detailed analysis of the proposed algorithms and conduct extensive simulations to show that PHSD can significantly outperform solutions proposed in the past in terms of the SRAM requirements and packet delay."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.162"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609381"",""Router memory";SRAM/DRAM;packet scheduling.;Routers;"Buffering"",""Random access memory";Internet;Switches;Delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Memory management;Packet switching;Performance analysis;Analytical models;"Scheduling algorithm"","""",""6"","""",""15"",""IEEE"",""29 Aug 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To guarantee delivery and improve performance, most position-based routing protocols, e.g., greedy-face-greedy (GFG), forward a message in greedy routing mode until the message is forwarded to a local minimum where greedy forwarding is impossible. They then switch to a less efficient mode known as face routing. Face routing requires the underlying network to be a planar graph which makes geometric routing only theoretically feasible. To remove this constraint, this paper tackles the local minimum problem with two new methods. First, we construct a virtual small-world network by adding virtual long links to the network to reduce the number of local minima. Second, we use the virtual force method to recover from local minima without relying on face routing. Combining these two methods, we propose a purely greedy routing protocol, the small-world iterative navigation greedy (SWING+) routing protocol. Simulations are conducted to evaluate SWING+ against existing geometric routing protocols. Simulation results show that SWING+ guarantees delivery, and that its performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art greedy other adaptive face routing (GOAFR+) routing protocol."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.103"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544510"",""Routing protocols";Algorithm/protocol design and analysis;Routing protocols;"Algorithm/protocol design and analysis"",""Routing protocols";Mobile ad hoc networks;Switches;Solid modeling;Iterative methods;Navigation;Mobile communication;"Network topology"","""",""5"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""17 Jun 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a result, they cannot better support VCR-oriented services in terms of substantive asynchronous clients, and free VCR controls for P2P VODs. In this paper, we propose VOVO, VCR-oriented VOD for large-scale P2P networks. By mining associations inside a video, the segments requested in VCR interactivities are accurately predicted based on the information collected through gossips. Together with a hybrid caching strategy, a collaborative prefetching scheme is proposed to optimize resource distribution among neighboring peers. We evaluate VOVO through extensive experiments. Results show that VOVO is scalable and effective, providing short startup latencies and good performance in VCR interactivities."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.102"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4540093"",""Protocols";Distributed Systems;Distributed applications;Protocols;Distributed Systems;"Distributed applications"",""Large-scale systems";Peer to peer computing;Prefetching;Streaming media;Video recording;Delay;Stress;Video sharing;"Collaboration"","""",""34"",""1"",""24"",""IEEE"",""13 Jun 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
