Here, we propose a network architecture for supporting a fundamental type of group communication, conferencing. A conference refers to a group of members in a network who communicate with each other within the group. We consider adopting a class of multistage networks, such as a baseline, an omega, or an indirect binary cube network, composed of switch modules with fan-in and fan-out capability for a conference network which supports multiple disjoint conferences. The key issue in designing a conference network is to determine the multiplicity of routing conflicts, which is the maximum number of conflict parties competing a single interstage link when multiple disjoint conferences simultaneously present in the network. Our results show that, for a network of size n /spl times/ n, the multiplicities of routing conflicts are small constants (between 2 and 4) for an omega network or an indirect binary cube network";" while it can be as large as /spl radic/n/q + 1 for a baseline network, where q is the minimum allowable conference size. Thus, our design for conference networks is based on an omega network or an indirect binary cube network. We also develop fast self-routing algorithms for setting up routing paths in the newly designed conference networks. As can be seen, such an n /spl times/ n conference network has O(logn) routing time and communication delay and O(nlogn) hardware cost. The conference networks are superior to existing designs in terms of routing complexity, communication delay and hardware cost. The conference network proposed is rearrangeably nonblocking in general, and is strictly nonblocking under some conference service policy. It can be used in applications that require efficient or real-time group communication."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.1264808"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264808"","""",""Communication switching";Routing;Application software;Switches;Hardware;Costs;Collaboration;Computer Society;Computer architecture;"Algorithm design and analysis"","""",""12"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""19 Feb 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

More specifically, under this architecture, core routers do not maintain any QoS reservation states, whether per-flow or aggregate. Instead, the QoS reservation states are stored at and managed by a bandwidth broker. There are several advantages of such a bandwidth broker architecture. Among others, it avoids the problem of inconsistent QoS states faced by the conventional hop-by-hop, distributed admission control approach. Furthermore, it allows us to design efficient admission control algorithms without incurring any overhead at core routers. The proposed bandwidth broker architecture is designed based on a core stateless virtual time reference system developed recently. This virtual time reference system provides a unifying framework to characterize, in terms of their abilities to support delay guarantees, both the per-hop behaviors of core routers and the end-to-end properties of their concatenation. We focus on the design of efficient admission control algorithms under the proposed bandwidth broker architecture. We consider both per-flow end-to-end guaranteed delay services and class-based guaranteed delay services with flow aggregation. Using our bandwidth broker architecture, we demonstrate how admission control can be done on a per domain basis instead of on a """"hop-by-hop"""" basis. Such an approach may significantly reduce the complexity of the admission control algorithms. In designing class-based admission control algorithms, we investigate the problem of dynamic flow aggregation in providing guaranteed delay services and devise a new apparatus to effectively circumvent this problem.

By choosing different outer and inner solvers and by controlling its two-level partition, PTH can deliver better performance for different applications on different machine ensembles and problem sizes. In an extreme case, the two levels of parallelism can be merged into one, and PTH can be the best algorithm otherwise available.

The Web server can provide N/spl ges/1 classes of proportional-delay differentiated services (PDDS) to heterogeneous clients. An operator can specify fixed performance spacings between classes, namely, r/sub i,i+1/>1, for i=1,..., N-1. Requests in class i+1 are guaranteed to have an average waiting time which is 1/r/sub i,i+1/ of the average waiting time of class i requests. With PDDS, we can provide consistent performance spacings over a wide range of system loading and this simplifies many pricing issues. In addition, each client can specify a maximum average waiting time requirement to be guaranteed by the PDDS-enabled Web server. We show that, in general, the problem of assigning clients to service classes in order to optimize system efficacy is NP-complete. We propose two efficient admission control algorithms so that a Web server can provide the QoS guarantees and, at the same time, classify each client to its """"lowest"""" admissible class, resulting in lowest usage cost for the admitted client. We also consider how to perform end-point dynamic adaptation such that admitted clients can submit requests at a lower class and further reduce their usage costs without violating their QoS requirements.

In a stateless approach, the server is unaware of the cache contents at a mobile user (MU). Even though stateless approaches employ simple database management schemes, they lack scalability and ability to support user disconnectedness and mobility. On the other hand, a stateful approach is scalable for large database systems at the cost of nontrivial overhead due to server database management. We propose a novel algorithm, called Scalable Asynchronous Cache Consistency Scheme (SACCS), which inherits the positive features of both stateless and stateful approaches. SACCS provides a weak cache consistency for unreliable communication (e.g., wireless mobile) environments with small stale cache hit probability. It is also a highly scalable algorithm with minimum database management overhead. The properties are accomplished through the use of flag bits at the server cache (SC) and MU cache (MUC), an identifier (ID) in MUC for each entry after its invalidation, and estimated time-to-live (TTL) for each cached entry, as well as rendering of all valid entries of MUC to uncertain state when an MU wakes up. The stale cache hit probability is analyzed and also simulated under the Rayleigh fading model of error-prone wireless channels.

They do not involve specialized interprocessor networks, so the latency of data communications is rather long. The programming models for PC clusters are often different than those for parallel machines or supercomputers containing sophisticated interprocessor communication networks. For PC clusters, load balancing among the nodes becomes a more critical issue in attempts to yield high performance. We introduce a new model for program development on PC clusters, namely, the super-programming model (SPM). The workload is modeled as a collection of super-instructions (SIs). We propose that a set of SIs be designed for each application domain. They should constitute an orthogonal set of frequently used high-level operations in the corresponding application domain. Each SI should normally be implemented as a high-level language routine that can execute on any PC. Application programs are modeled as super-programs (SPs), which are coded using SIs. SIs are dynamically assigned to available PCs at runtime. Because of the known granularity of SIs, an upper bound on their execution time can be estimated at static time. Therefore, dynamic load balancing becomes an easier task. Our motivation is to support dynamic load balancing and code porting, especially for applications with diverse sets of inputs such as data mining. We apply here SPM to the implementation of an a priori-like algorithm for mining association rules.

The key idea of ZRP is that each node proactively advertises its link state over a fixed number of hops, called the zone radius. These local advertisements provide each node with an updated view of its routing zone - the collection of all nodes and links that are reachable within the zone radius. The nodes on the boundary of the routing zone are called peripheral nodes and play an important role in the reactive zone-based route discovery. The main contribution of this work is to propose a novel hybrid routing protocol - the two-zone routing protocol (TZRP) - as a nontrivial extension of ZRP. In contrast with the original ZRP where a single zone serves a dual purpose, TZRP aims to decouple the protocol's ability to adapt to traffic characteristics from its ability to adapt to mobility. In support of this goal, in TZRP each node maintains two zones: a crisp zone and a fuzzy zone. By adjusting the sizes of these two zones independently, a lower total routing control overhead can be achieved. Extensive simulation results show that TZRP is a general MANET routing framework that can balance the trade offs between various routing control overheads more effectively than ZRP in a wide range of network conditions."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.73"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353243"",""Mobile ad hoc networks";hybrid protocols;routing protocols;"zone routing."",""Routing protocols";Mobile ad hoc networks;Size control;Traffic control;Ad hoc networks;Wireless communication;Law enforcement;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Throughput;"Communication system control"","""",""53"",""2"",""29"",""IEEE"",""8 Nov 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

We propose a data-driven strategy to optimize the memory energy consumption in a banked memory system. Our compiler-based strategy modifies the original execution order of loop iterations in array-dominated applications to increase the length of the time period(s) in which memory banks are idle (i.e., not accessed by any loop iteration). To achieve this, it first classifies loop iterations according to their bank accesses patterns and then, with the help of a polyhedral tool, tries to bring the iterations with similar bank access patterns close together. Increasing the idle periods of memory banks brings two major benefits: first, it allows us to place more memory banks into low-power operating modes and, second, it enables us to use a more aggressive (i.e., more energy saving) operating mode (hence, saving more energy) for a given bank (instead of a less aggressive mode). The proposed strategy can reduce memory energy consumption in both sequential and parallel applications. Our strategy has been implemented in an experimental compiler using a polyhedral tool and evaluated using nine array-dominated applications on both a cacheless system and a system with cache memory. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy is very successful in reducing the memory system energy and improves the memory energy by as much as 36.8 percent over a strategy that uses low-power modes without optimizing data access pattern. Our results also show that optimizations that target reducing off-chip memory energy can generate very different results from those that target at improving only cache locality."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.1271179"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271179"","""",""Energy consumption";Embedded system;Optimizing compilers;Computer Society;Cache memory;Batteries;Hardware;System-on-a-chip;Energy management;"Circuits"","""",""7"","""",""50"",""IEEE"",""8 Mar 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Xiao et al., 2002). In such a system, a small number of running jobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements, slowing down execution of each individual job and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster. Since the memory demand of jobs may not be known in advance and may change dynamically, the possibility of unsuitable job submissions/migrations to cause the blocking problem is high, and existing load sharing schemes are unable to effectively handle this problem. We propose two schemes to address this problem. The first scheme, network RAM supported load sharing, combines job migrations with network RAM, which uses remote execution to initially allocate a job to the most lightly loaded workstation and, if necessary, network RAM to provide a global memory space for the job larger than it would be available otherwise. This scheme has the merits of both job migrations and network RAM. Our experiments show its effectiveness and scalability. However, this scheme requires a network RAM facility in the cluster, which may cause additional overhead and increase cluster network traffic. In order to address this limit, we propose a second scheme, memory reservation, incorporated with dynamic load sharing, which adaptively reserves a small set of workstations to provide special services to the jobs demanding large memory allocations. As soon as the blocking problem is resolved by the memory reservation scheme, the system will adaptively switch back to the normal load sharing state. Both schemes target on handling large data-intensive jobs in clusters, and are mutually complementary. The network RAM supported load sharing scheme can fully utilize the cluster global memory space, while the memory reservation scheme has the advantage of simple implementations and low overhead.

Current proposals use the up*/down* routing algorithm to remove cyclic dependencies between channels and avoid deadlock. However, routing is considerably restricted and most messages must follow nonminimal paths, increasing latency and wasting resources. We propose and evaluate a simple and effective methodology to compute up*/down* routing tables. The new methodology is based on computing a depth-first search (DPS) spanning tree on the network graph that decreases the number of routing restrictions with respect to the breadth-first search (BFS) spanning tree used by the traditional methodology. Additionally, we propose different heuristic rules for computing the spanning trees to improve the efficiency of up*/down* routing.

Typically, each station has access to a few channels for transmitting and receiving messages. By RN(p, k), we denote a radio network with p stations, where each station has access to k channels. In a single-hop RN, every station is within the transmission range of every other station. Each station consumes power while transmitting or receiving a message, even when it receives a message that is not destined for it. It is extremely important that the stations consume power only when it is necessary since it is not possible to recharge batteries when the stations are on a mission. We are interested in designing an energy-efficient protocol for permutation routing, which is one of the most fundamental problems in any distributed system. An instance of the permutation routing problem involves p stations of an RN, each storing n/p items. Each item has a unique destination address which is the identity of the destination station to which the item should be sent. The goal is to route all the items to their destinations while consuming as little energy as possible. We show that the permutation routing problem of n packets on an RN(p, k) can be solved in 2n/k+(p/k)/sup 2/+p+2k/sup 2/ slots and each station needs to be awake for at most 6n/p+2p/k+8k slots.

In this paper, we examine the impact of data dependence analysis in practice. A number of data dependence tests have been proposed in the literature. In each test, there are different trade offs between accuracy and efficiency. We present an experimental evaluation of several data dependence tests, including the Banerjee test, the I-Test, and the Omega test. We compare these tests in terms of data dependence accuracy, compilation efficiency, effectiveness in parallelization, and program execution performance. We analyze the reasons why a data dependence test can be inexact and we explain how the examined tests handle such cases. We run various experiments using the Perfect Club Benchmarks and the scientific library Lapack. We present the measured accuracy of each test and the reasons for any approximation. We compare these tests in term's of efficiency and we analyze the trade offs between accuracy and efficiency. We also determine the impact of each data dependence test on the total compilation time. Finally, we measure the number of loops parallelized by each test and we compare the execution performance of each benchmark on a multiprocessor. Our results indicate that the Omega test is more accurate, but also very inefficient in the cases where the other two tests are inaccurate. In general, the cost of the Omega test is high and uses a significant percentage of the total compilation time.

Routing based on a connected dominating set is a promising approach, where the search space for a route is reduced to the hosts in the set. A set is dominating if all the hosts in the system are either in the set or neighbors of hosts in the set. The efficiency of dominating-set-based routing mainly depends on the overhead introduced in the formation of the dominating set and the size of the dominating set. In this paper, we first review a localized formation of a connected dominating set called marking process and dominating-set-based routing. Then, we propose a dominant pruning rule to reduce the size of the dominating set. This dominant pruning rule (called Rule k) is a generalization of two existing rules (called Rule 1 and Rule 2, respectively). We prove that the vertex set derived by applying Rule k is still a connected dominating set. Rule k is more effective in reducing the dominating set derived from the marking process than the combination of Rules 1 and 2 and, surprisingly, in a restricted implementation with local neighborhood information, Rule k has the same communication complexity and less computation complexity. Simulation results confirm that Rule k outperforms Rules 1 and 2, especially in networks with relatively high vertex degree and high percentage of unidirectional links. We also prove that an upper bound exists on the average size of the dominating set derived from Rule k in its restricted implementation."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.48"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327595"",""Ad hoc wireless networks";dominant pruning;dominating sets;routing;probabilistic analysis;"simulation."",""Intelligent networks";Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Upper bound;Analytical models;Energy states;"Maintenance"","""",""364"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""30 Aug 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

As a solution, a scalable address subnetwork called symmetric multiprocessor network (SYMNET) is proposed in which address requests and snoop responses of SMPs are implemented optically. SYMNET not only uses passive optical interconnects that increases the speed of the proposed network, but also pipelines address requests at a much faster rate than electronics. This increases the address bandwidth for snooping, but the preservation of cache coherence can no longer be maintained with the usual snooping protocols. A modified coherence protocol, coherence in SYMNET (COSYM), is introduced to solve the coherence problem. COSYM was evaluated with a subset of Splash-2 benchmarks and compared with the electrical bus-based MOESI protocol. The simulation studies have shown a 5-66 percent improvement in execution time for COSYM as compared to MOESI for various applications. Simulations have also shown that the average latency for a transaction to complete using COSYM protocol was 5-78 percent better than the MOESI protocol.

It is shown that, in order to achieve bounded correctness, the rate at which nodes fail and are repaired must be limited. This requirement is quantified by defining a minimum state holding time in the system.

We present a novel packet scheduling algorithm, called eligibility-based round robin (EBRR), devised to provide fair queueing in interconnection networks.

Consequently, designers must keep a network below its saturation point by reducing the load on the network. Congestion control via source throttling-a common technique to reduce the network load-prevents new packets from entering the network in the presence of congestion. Unfortunately, prior schemes to implement source throttling either lack vital global information about the network to make the correct decision (whether to throttle or not) or depend on specific network parameters, or communication patterns. This paper presents a global-knowledge-based, self-tuned, congestion control technique that prevents saturation at high loads across different communication patterns for k-ary n-cube networks. Our design is composed of two key components. First, we use global information about a network to obtain a timely estimate of network congestion. We compare this estimate to a threshold value to determine when to throttle packet injection. The second component is a self-tuning mechanism that automatically determines appropriate threshold values based on throughput feedback. A combination of these two techniques provides high performance under heavy load, does not penalize performance under light load, and gracefully adapts to changes in communication patterns."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.1264810"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264810"","""",""Throughput";Delay;Degradation;Communication system control;Bandwidth;Feedback;Automatic control;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Multiprocessing systems;"Out of order"","""",""26"",""14"",""33"",""IEEE"",""19 Feb 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

This is normally achieved by implementing virtual networks with the help of virtual channels or virtual lanes multiplexed on a single physical network. To keep the coherence protocol simple, messages are usually assigned to virtual lanes in a predefined static manner based on a cycle-free lane assignment dependence graph. However, this static split of virtual networks (such as request and reply networks) may lead to underutilization of certain virtual networks while saturating the other networks. In this paper, we explore different static and dynamic schemes to select the virtual lanes for outgoing messages and mix the load among them without restricting any particular type of message to be carried only by a particular virtual network. We achieve this by exposing the selection algorithms to the coherence protocol itself, so that it can inject messages into selected virtual lanes based on some local information, and still enjoy deadlock-freedom. Our execution-driven simulation on five applications from the SPLASH-2 suite shows that as the system scales, the virtual network selection algorithms play an important role. For 128-node systems, our dynamic selection algorithm speeds up parallel execution by as much as 22 percent over an optimized baseline system running a modified SGI Origin 2000 protocol. We also explore how network latency, the number of message buffers per virtual lane, and the depth of network interface output queues affect the relative performance of various virtual lane selection algorithms."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.35"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333640"",""Distributed shared memory";cache coherence protocol;virtual network;"deadlock-freedom."",""Intelligent networks";System recovery;Network interfaces;Heuristic algorithms;Delay;Inspection;"Routing protocols"","""",""4"",""2"",""26"",""IEEE"",""13 Sep 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

This is because interoperation optimization (or: time-optimization of communication steps across library calls) is generally not incorporated in the library implementations. We present a simple, efficient, finite state machine-based approach for communication minimization of library-based data parallel regular domain problems.

Apart from being simple and cheap, lazy parallelization guarantees to generate legal, correct, and efficient parallel programs at all times. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by analyzing the performance characteristics of two typical regular domain problems obtained from the field of low-level image processing.

In this article, we propose a transcoding-enabled bandwidth allocation scheme for service differentiation on streaming servers. It aims to deliver high bit rate streams to high priority request classes without overcompromising low priority request classes. We investigate the problem of providing differentiated streaming services at application level in two aspects: stream bandwidth allocation and request scheduling. We formulate the bandwidth allocation problem as an optimization of a harmonic utility function of the stream quality factors and derive the optimal streaming bit rates for requests of different classes under various server load conditions. We prove that the optimal allocation, referred to as harmonic proportional allocation, not only maximizes the system utility function, but also guarantees proportional fair sharing between classes with different prespecified differentiation weights. We evaluate the allocation scheme, in combination with two popular request scheduling approaches, via extensive simulations and compare it with an absolute differentiation strategy and a proportional-share strategy tailored from relative differentiation in networking. Simulation results show that the harmonic proportional allocation scheme can meet the objective of relative differentiation in both short and long timescales and greatly enhance the service availability and maintain low queueing delay when the streaming system is highly loaded."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.43"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333654"",""Service differentiation";harmonic proportional bandwidth allocation;video transcoding;streaming bit rate;"feedback queue."",""Channel allocation";Network servers;Web server;Bit rate;Streaming media;Web and internet services;Transcoding;Bandwidth;Communication system control;"Q factor"","""",""36"",""2"",""45"",""IEEE"",""13 Sep 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Useful optimizations and parallelization can be performed if it is known that certain points-to relationships would hold with high or low probabilities. For instance, if the probabilities are low, a compiler could transform programs to perform data speculation or partition iterations into threads in speculative multithreading, or it would avoid conducting code specialization. Consequently, it is essential for compilers to incorporate pointer analysis techniques that can estimate the possibility for every points-to relationship that it would hold during the execution. However, conventional pointer analysis techniques do not provide such quantitative descriptions and, thus, hinder compilers from more aggressive optimizations, such as thread partitioning in speculative multithreading, data speculations, code specialization, etc. We address this issue by proposing a probabilistic points-to analysis technique to compute the probability of every points-to relationship at each program point. A context-sensitive interprocedural algorithm has been implemented based on the iterative data flow analysis framework, and has been incorporated into SUIF and MachSUIF. Experimental results show this technique can estimate the probabilities of points-to relationships in benchmark programs with reasonable small errors, about 4.6 percent on average. Furthermore, the current implementation cannot disambiguate heap and array elements. The errors are further significantly reduced when the future implementation incorporates techniques to disambiguate heap and array elements."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.56"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327594"",""Multithreading";speculation;interprocedural program analysis;points-to analysis;compilers;"optimization."",""Optimizing compilers";Profitability;Program processors;Multithreading;Computer architecture;Hardware;Partitioning algorithms;Iterative algorithms;"Data analysis"","""",""19"",""1"",""33"",""IEEE"",""30 Aug 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;

The multiprocessor utilization bound is a function of the allocation algorithm, so among all the allocation algorithms there exists at least one allocation algorithm providing the minimum multiprocessor utilization bound, and one allocation algorithm providing the maximum multiprocessor utilization bound. We prove that the multiprocessor utilization bound associated with the allocation heuristic worst fit (WF) coincides with that minimum if we use Liu and Layland's bound (LLB) as the uniprocessor schedulability condition.

Such a router contains many line cards (LCs) for admitting external links of various speeds. Those LCs are interconnected by a switching fabric to provide paths for packets to travel from arrival LCs to their respective departure LCs. The switching fabric employed in a router dictates the scalability and the overall performance of the router. It is thus crucial for future multiterabit routers to incorporate scalable switching fabrics capable of interconnecting large numbers of LCs. This work considers switching fabrics with distributed packet routing to achieve high scalability and low costs. Our fabrics are based on a multistage structure with different recirculation designs, where adjacent stages are interconnected according to the indirect n-cube connection style. They all compare favorably with an earlier multistage-based counterpart according to extensive simulation, in terms of performance measures of interest and hardware complexity. When queues are incorporated in the output ports of switching elements (SEs), the total number of stages required in our proposed fabrics to achieve a given performance level can be reduced substantially. The performance of those fabrics with output queues is evaluated under different """"speedups"""" of the queues, where the speedup is the operating clock rate ratio of that at the SE core to that over external links. It is found via our simulation results that a small speedup of two is adequate for buffered switching fabrics comprising 4/spl times/8 SEs to deliver better performance than their nonbuffered counterparts with 50 percent more stages of SEs, when the fabric size is 256. The buffered switching fabrics under different traffic patterns are evaluated and discussed as well. Being scalable and of low costs, the proposed switching fabrics are ideally suitable for routers with large numbers of LCs."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.1271180"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271180"","""",""Fabrics";Packet switching;Scalability;Costs;High-speed networks;Aggregates;Routing;Hardware;Clocks;"Traffic control"","""",""8"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""8 Mar 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

We generalize the theory of the classical max-min rate allocation with the support of both the minimum rate and peak rate constraints for each flow. Additionally, to achieve generalized max-min rate allocation in a fully distributed packet network, we present a distributed algorithm that uses a feedback-based flow control mechanism. Our design not only offers a fresh perspective on flow marking technique, but also advances the state-of-the-art flow marking technique favored by other researchers.

We propose here a new sparse planar structure, namely, partial Delaunay triangulation (PDT), which can be constructed locally and is denser than other known localized planar structures. In the next mandatory phase, the degree of each node is limited to seven by applying the Yao structure, and the master-slave relations in piconets are formed in created subgraphs.

In this paper, we first propose an enhanced version of the generic protocol, which is more elegant in interpreting existing protocols and has a simpler correctness proof. Then, we evaluate the performance of the family of self-pruning protocols under various network situations with ns2. The objective is to observe the efficiency and reliability of these protocols as a function of network density, congestion, and mobility, and provide a guideline of implementation in the """"real world"""". Our performance analysis reveals that the protocol reliability is barely affected by packet collision. However, most self-pruning protocols suffer from low delivery ratio in highly mobile networks. We further explore various techniques that improve the delivery ratio and show that both high efficiency and reliability can be achieved in highly mobile networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.69"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339252"",""Ad hoc networks";broadcasting;localized algorithms;ns{\hbox{-}}2 simulation;"self-pruning."",""Performance analysis";Broadcasting;Protocols;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Wireless networks;Guidelines;Floods;Wireless communication;"Storms"","""",""43"",""4"",""22"",""IEEE"",""4 Oct 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

First, we propose a greedy slack stealing algorithm to deal with applications represented by AND/OR graphs and prove its correctness in terms of meeting the timing constraints. Then, using statistical information about the applications, we propose a few variations of speculative scheduling algorithms that intend to save energy by reducing the number of speed changes (and, thus, the overhead) while ensuring that the application meets its timing constraints. Some practical issues are also considered, such as shared memory access contention and idle energy consumption. The performance of the algorithms is analyzed with respect to processor energy savings. The results surprisingly show that the greedy slack stealing scheme is better than some speculative schemes and that the greedy scheme is good enough when a reasonable minimal speed exists in the system or when there are only a few (four to six) voltage/speed levels."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.45"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333655"",""Power-aware scheduling";AND/OR;"real-time systems."",""Real time systems";Energy consumption;Timing;Processor scheduling;Energy management;Power system management;Power system modeling;Scheduling algorithm;Performance analysis;"Algorithm design and analysis"","""",""64"",""1"",""28"",""IEEE"",""13 Sep 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

Recently, methods have been developed that transform memory layouts of data structures at compile-time to improve spatial locality of nested loops beyond current control-centric (loop nest-based) optimizations. Most of these data-centric transformations use a single static (program-wide) memory layout for each array. A disadvantage of these static layout-based locality enhancement strategies is that they might fail to optimize codes that manipulate arrays, which demand different layouts in different parts of the code. We introduce a new approach, which extends current static layout optimization techniques by associating different memory layouts with the same array in different parts of the code. We call this strategy """"quasidynamic layout optimization."""" In this strategy, the compiler determines memory layouts (for different parts of the code) at compile time, but layout conversions occur at runtime. We show that the possibility of dynamically changing memory layouts during the course of execution adds a new dimension to the data locality optimization problem.

Previous works have pointed out that the standard protocol can be very inefficient and that an appropriate tuning of its congestion control mechanism (i.e., the backoff algorithm) can drive the IEEE 802.11 protocol close to its optimal behavior. To perform this tuning, a station must have exact knowledge of the network contention level";" unfortunately, in a real case, a station cannot have exact knowledge of the network contention level (i.e., number of active stations and length of the message transmitted on the channel), but it, at most, can estimate it. We present and evaluate a distributed mechanism for contention control in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. Our mechanism, named asymptotically optimal backoff (AOB), dynamically adapts the backoff window size to the current network contention level and guarantees that an IEEE 802.11 WLAN asymptotically achieves its optimal channel utilization. The AOB mechanism measures the network contention level by using two simple estimates: the slot utilization and the average size of transmitted frames. These estimates are simple and can be obtained by exploiting information that is already available in the standard protocol. AOB can be used to extend the standard 802.11 access mechanism without requiring any additional hardware. The performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol, with and without the AOB mechanism, is investigated through simulation.

Further, it has the property that the load can be partitioned arbitrarily into any number of portions and can be scheduled onto processors independently for computation. The load is assumed to arrive at one of the farthest end processors, referred to as boundary processors, for processing. The processors in the network are assumed to have nonzero release times, i.e., the time instants from which the processors are available for processing the divisible load. Our objective is to design a load distribution strategy by taking into account the release times of the processors in such a way that the entire processing time of the load is a minimum. We consider two generic cases in which all processors have identical release times and when all processors have arbitrary release times. We adopt both the single and multiinstallment strategies proposed in the divisible load scheduling literature in our design of load distribution strategies, wherever necessary, to achieve a minimum processing time.

In such a hierarchy, second-level buffer caches have different access patterns from first-level buffer caches because accesses to a second-level are actually misses from a first-level. Therefore, commonly used cache management algorithms such as the least recently used (LRU) replacement algorithm that work well for single-level buffer caches may not work well for second-level. We investigate multiple approaches to effectively manage second-level buffer caches. In particular, we report our research results in 1) second-level buffer cache access pattern characterization, 2) a new local algorithm called multi-queue (MQ) that performs better than nine tested alternative algorithms for second-level buffer caches, 3) a set of global algorithms that manage a multilevel buffer cache hierarchy globally and significantly improve second-level buffer cache hit ratios over corresponding local algorithms, and 4) implementation and evaluation of these algorithms in a real storage system connected with commercial database servers (Microsoft SQL server and Oracle) running industrial-strength online transaction processing benchmarks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.13"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291820"",""Cache memories";storage hierarchy;"storage management."",""Buffer storage";File servers;Cache storage;Aggregates;Network servers;Performance evaluation;System testing;Transaction databases;Memory management;"Bridges"","""",""84"",""16"",""51"",""IEEE"",""4 May 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

We present the first robust contributory key agreement protocol resilient to any sequence of group changes. The protocol, based on the Group Diffie-Hellman contributory key agreement, uses the services of a group communication system supporting virtual synchrony semantics. We prove that it provides both virtual synchrony and the security properties of Group Diffie-Hellman, in the presence of any sequence of (potentially cascading) node failures, recoveries, network partitions, and heals.

We present techniques for managing two important resources-CPU and network interface bandwidth-on a cluster-wide basis. Our techniques allow Sharc to 1) support reservation of CPU and network interface bandwidth for distributed applications, 2) dynamically allocate resources based on past usage, and 3) provide performance isolation to applications.

However, it is difficult to build a real-time control network using the standard Ethernet because the Ethernet MAC protocol-1-persistent CSMA/CD protocol-may cause unpredictable access delay. When both real-time and nonreal-time packets are concurrently transported over an ordinary Ethernet, real-time (RT) packets from a node may experience a large delay due to 1) contention with nonRT packets in the local node where they originate and 2) collision with RT and nonRT packets from the other nodes. To resolve this problem, we design, implement, and evaluate an adaptive traffic smoother. Specifically, we design two adaptive traffic smoothers, one at the kernel level and the other at the user level. The kernel-level traffic smoother is installed between the IP layer and the Ethernet MAC layer for better performance, and the user-level traffic smoother is installed on top of the transport layer for better portability. The kernel-level traffic smoother first gives RT packets priority over nonRT packets in order to eliminate contention within the local node. Second, it smoothes nonRT traffic so as to reduce collision with RT packets from the other nodes. This traffic smoothing can dramatically decrease the packet-collision probability on the network. The traffic smoother, installed at each node, regulates the node's outgoing nonRT traffic to maintain a certain rate. In order to provide a reasonable nonRT throughput while providing probabilistic delay guarantees for RT traffic, the nonRT traffic-generation rate is allowed to adapt itself to the underlying network load condition. Our implementation of the traffic smoother requires only a minimal change in the OS kernel without any modification to the current standard of Ethernet MAC protocol or the TCP or UDP/IP stack. The traffic smoother has been implemented on the Linux OS and is shown to reduce the RT message deadline-miss ratio up to two orders of magnitude under a heavily loaded condition, while the nonRT throughput drops only by half. For better portability, we also implemented and evaluated a user-level traffic smoother on top of the transport layer. Moreover, we emulate a switch using a kernel-level traffic smoother to evaluate the performance of traffic smoother in a switched Ethernet environment that can scale to a large control network."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.59"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327598"",""1-persistent CSMA/CD";Ethernet;real-time communication;"traffic smoothing."",""Ethernet networks";Smoothing methods;Telecommunication traffic;Communication system traffic control;Communication system control;Media Access Protocol;Road accidents;Kernel;Throughput;"Switches"","""",""16"",""3"",""15"",""IEEE"",""30 Aug 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

Also, it enables service providers to customize features for the clients. In this work, we extend this client-server collaboration further by offloading some of the computations (i.e., method execution and dynamic compilation) normally performed by the mobile client to the resource-rich server in order to conserve energy consumed by the client in a wireless Java environment. In the proposed framework, the object serialization feature of Java is used to allow offloading of both method execution and bytecode-to-native code compilation to the server when executing a Java application. Our framework takes into account communication, computation, and compilation energies to decide where to compile and execute a method (locally or remotely), and how to execute it (using interpretation or just-in-time compilation with different levels of optimizations). As both computation and communication energies vary based on external conditions (such as the wireless channel state and user supplied inputs), our decision must be done dynamically when a method is invoked. Our experiments, using a set of Java applications executed on a simulation framework, reveal that the proposed techniques are very effective in conserving the energy of the mobile client."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.47"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333651"",""Client/server";Java;"runtime environment."",""Java";Mobile computing;Communication system security;Batteries;Energy consumption;Mobile handsets;Collaborative work;Dynamic compiler;Optimization methods;"Computational modeling"","""",""91"",""10"",""32"",""IEEE"",""13 Sep 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";

We present possible protocol optimizations to minimize these retries and offer a thorough study of the performance effects of these messages on six scalable scientific applications running on 64-node systems and larger. To eliminate NACKs, we present a mechanism to queue pending requests at the main memory of the home node and augment it with a novel technique of combining pending read requests, thereby accelerating the parallel execution for 64 nodes by as much as 41 percent (a speedup of 1.41) compared to a modified version of the SGI Origin 2000 protocol. We further design and evaluate a protocol by combining this mechanism with a technique that we call write string forwarding, used in the AlphaServer GS320 and Piranha systems. We find that without careful design considerations, especially regarding atomic read-modify-write operations, this aggressive write forwarding can hurt performance. We identify and evaluate the necessary micro-architectural support to solve this problem. We compare the performance of these novel NACK-free protocols with a base bitvector protocol, a modified version of the SGI Origin 2000 protocol, and a NACK-free protocol that uses dirty sharing and write string forwarding as in the Piranha system.

In this approach, each replica is associated with an expiration time beyond which the replica has to be validated. While the expiration-based scheme has been investigated in the context of a single replica, not much work has been done on its behaviors with respect to multiple replicas. To allow for efficient consistency management, it is desirable to organize the replicas into a distribution tree where a lower level replica seeks validation with a higher level replica when its lifetime expires. This paper investigates the construction of a distribution tree for a given set of replicas with the objective of minimizing the total communication cost of consistency management. This is formulated as an optimization problem and is proven to be NP-complete. The optimal distribution tree is identified in some special cases and several heuristic algorithms are proposed for the general problem. The performance of the heuristic algorithms is experimentally evaluated against two classical graph-theoretic algorithms of tree construction: the shortest-paths tree and the minimum spanning tree."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2004.1264807"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264807"","""",""Costs";Content management;Tree graphs;Network servers;Heuristic algorithms;Performance analysis;Graph theory;Load management;"Content based retrieval"","""",""6"",""1"",""32"",""IEEE"",""19 Feb 2004"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

Since this scheduling problem is NP-hard, UPA heuristically computes schedules with a quadratic worst-case cost, faster than the previously best CMA algorithm. Our simulation studies show that UPA performs the same as or significantly better than CMA for a broad set of TUFs. Furthermore, we implement UPA and prototype a TUF-driven switched Ethernet system.
