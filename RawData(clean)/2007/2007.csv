First, as groundwork for secure services in IBA, we present partition-level and queue pair-level key management schemes, both of which can be easily integrated into IBA. Second, for confidentiality and authentication, we present a method to incorporate a scalable encryption and authentication algorithm into IBA with little performance overhead. Third, for better availability, we propose a stateful ingress filtering mechanism to block denial of service (DoS) attacks. Finally, to further improve the availability, we provide a scalable packet marking method tracing back DoS attacks. Simulation results of an IBA network show that the security performance overhead due to encryption/authentication on network latency ranges from 0.7% to 12.4%.

This paper presents Attack Diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy. AD combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking, and its architecture is in line with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm—attack detection is performed near the victim host and packet filtering is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense mechanism that is activated by a victim host after an attack is detected. By instructing its upstream routers to mark packets deterministically, the victim can trace back one attack source and command an AD-enabled router close to the source to filter the attack packets. This process isolates one attacker and throttles it, which is repeated until the attack is mitigated. We also propose an extension to AD called Parallel Attack Diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attackers simultaneously.

This paper presents in a unified manner a partitioning approach for providing a latency below a threshold to the maximum number of users as possible in DVE systems. This partitioning approach searches the assignment of avatars, which represents the best trade-off among system latency, system throughput, and partitioning efficiency when solving the partitioning problem. Evaluation results show that the proposed approach not only maximizes system throughput, but also allows the system to satisfy, if possible, any specific latency requirement needed for providing QoS.

We present a distributed algorithm for solving the group mutual exclusion problem based on the notion of surrogate-quorum. Intuitively, our algorithm uses the quorum that has been successfully locked by a request as a surrogate to service other compatible requests for the same type of critical section. Unlike the existing quorum-based algorithms for group mutual exclusion, our algorithm achieves a low message complexity of O(q) and a low (amortized) bit-message complexity of O(bqr), where q is the maximum size of a quorum, b is the maximum number of processes from which a node can receive critical section requests, and r is the maximum size of a request while maintaining both synchronization delay and waiting time at two message hops. As opposed to some existing quorum-based algorithms, our algorithm can adapt without performance penalties to dynamic changes in the set of groups. Our simulation results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the existing quorum-based algorithms for group mutual exclusion by as much as 45 percent in some cases. We also discuss how our algorithm can be extended to satisfy certain desirable properties such as concurrent entry and unnecessary blocking freedom."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.1072"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302724"",""message-passing system";resource management;mutual exclusion;group mutual exclusion;"quorumbased algorithm"",""Delay effects";Computer Society;Distributed algorithms;Resource management;"Concurrent computing"","""",""21"",""2"",""24"",""IEEE"",""17 Sep 2007"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An up*/down* routing algorithm, which has been widely used to avoid deadlocks in irregular networks, tends to make unbalanced paths as it employs a one-dimensional directed graph. The current study introduces a two-dimensional directed graph on which adaptive routings called left-up first turn (L-turn) routings and right-down last turn (R-turn) routings are proposed to make the paths as uniformly distributed as possible. This scheme guarantees deadlock-freedom because it uses the turn model approach, and the extra degree of freedom in the two-dimensional graph helps to ensure that the prohibited turns are well-distributed. Simulation results show that better throughput and latency results from uniformly distributing the prohibited turns by which the traffic would be more distributed toward the leaf nodes.

By exploring the spatial correlation of sensing data, we dynamically partition the sensor nodes into clusters so that the sensors in the same cluster have similar surveillance time series. They can share the workload of data collection in the future since their future readings may likely be similar. Furthermore, during a short-time period, a sensor may report similar readings. Such a correlation in the data reported from the same sensor is called temporal correlation, which can be explored to further save energy.

Although the secure sockets layer (SSL) is the most popular protocol to provide a secure channel between a client and a cluster-based network server, its high overhead degrades the server performance considerably and, thus, affects the server scalability. Therefore, improving the performance of SSL-enabled network servers is critical for designing scalable and high-performance data centers. In this paper, we examine the impact of SSL offering and SSL-session-aware distribution in cluster-based network servers. We propose a back-end forwarding scheme, called ssl_with_bf, that employs a low-overhead user-level communication mechanism like virtual interface architecture (VIA) to achieve a good load balance among server nodes. We compare three distribution models for network servers, round robin (RR), ssl_with_session, and ssl_with_bf, through simulation. The experimental results with 16-node and 32-node cluster configurations show that, although the session reuse of ssl_with_session is critical to improve the performance of application servers, the proposed back-end forwarding scheme can further enhance the performance due to better load balancing.

This way of data collection enables complex analysis of data, which may not be possible with in-network aggregation or query processing. However, this flexibility in data analysis comes at the cost of power consumption. In this paper we develop ASAP − an adaptive sampling approach to energyefficient periodic data collection in sensor networks. The main idea behind ASAP is to use a dynamically changing subset of the nodes as samplers such that the sensor readings of the sampler nodes are directly collected, whereas the values of the non-sampler nodes are predicted through the use of probabilistic models that are locally and periodically constructed. ASAP can be effectively used to increase the network lifetime while keeping the quality of the collected data high, in scenarios where either the spatial density of the network deployment is superfluous relative to the required spatial resolution for data analysis or certain amount of data quality can be traded off in order to decrease the power consumption of the network. ASAP approach consists of three main mechanisms. First, sensing-driven cluster construction is used to create clusters within the network such that nodes with close sensor readings are assigned to the same clusters. Second, correlation-based sampler selection and model derivation are used to determine the sampler nodes and to calculate the parameters of the probabilistic models that capture the spatial and temporal correlations among the sensor readings. Last, adaptive data collection and model-based prediction are used to minimize the number of messages used to extract data from the network.

The most popular P2P application till today is file sharing, e.g., Gnutella, Kazza, etc. These systems are usually referred to as unstructured, and search in unstructured P2P networks usually involves flooding or random walking. On the other hand, in structured P2P networks (DHTs), search is usually performed by looking up a distributed inverted index. The efficiency of the search mechanism is the key to the scalability of a P2P content sharing system. So far, neither unstructured nor structured P2P networks alone can solve the search problem in a satisfactory way. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of both unstructured and structured P2P networks to achieve more efficient search. Specifically, we propose to enhance search in unstructured P2P overlay networks by building a partial index of shared data using a structured P2P network. The index maintains two types of information: the top interests of peers and globally unpopular data, both characterized by data properties. The proposed search protocol, assisted search with partial indexing, makes use of the index to improve search in three ways: first, the index assists peers to find other peers with similar interests and the unstructured search overlay is formed to reflect peer interests. Second, the index also provides search hints for those data difficult to locate by exploring peer interest locality, and these hints can be used for second-chance search. Third, the index helps to locate unpopular data items. Experiments based on a P2P file sharing trace show that the assisted search with a lightweight partial indexing service can significantly improve the success rate in locating data than Gnutella and a hit-rate-based protocol in unstructured P2P systems, while incurring low search latency and overheads."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.1035"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288111"",""C.2.4 Distributed Systems";"H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval"",""Peer to peer computing";Indexing;Protocols;Buildings;Network servers;Network topology;Legged locomotion;Scalability;Search problems;"Delay"","""",""50"","""",""45"",""IEEE"",""13 Aug 2007"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, predictions have not been incorporated into production schedulers, partially due to a misconception (that we resolve) claiming inaccuracy actually improves performance, but mainly because underprediction is technically unacceptable: users will not tolerate jobs being killed just because system predictions were too short. We solve this problem by divorcing kill-time from the runtime prediction and correcting predictions adaptively as needed if they are proved wrong. The end result is a surprisingly simple scheduler, which requires minimal deviations from current practices (e.g., using FCFS as the basis) and behaves exactly like EASY as far as users are concerned"; nevertheless, it achieves significant improvements in performance, predictability, and accuracy. Notably, this is based on a very simple runtime predictor that just averages the runtimes of the last two jobs by the same user;" counter intuitively, our results indicate that using recent data is more important than mining the history for similar jobs.

This distributed encoding is self-organized, with each node managing its in-degree and local connectivity via random-walk sampling. Assignment of incoming jobs to nodes with the most free resources is also accomplished by sampling the nodes via short random walks. Extensive simulations show that the resulting highly dynamic and self-organized graph structure can efficiently balance computational load throughout large-scale networks. These simulations cover a wide spectrum of cases, including significant heterogeneity in available computing resources and high burstiness in incoming load. Prior analytical results show BON's scalability for truly large-scale networks";" under certain ideal conditions, the network structure converges to Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graphs.

At the early stage of a DDoS attack, some traffic fluctuations are detectable at Internet routers or at the gateways of edge networks. We develop a distributed change-point detection (DCD) architecture using change aggregation trees (CAT). The idea is to detect abrupt traffic changes across multiple network domains at the earliest time. Early detection of DDoS attacks minimizes the floe cling damages to the victim systems serviced by the provider. The system is built over attack-transit routers, which work together cooperatively. Each ISP domain has a CAT server to aggregate the flooding alerts reported by the routers. CAT domain servers collaborate among themselves to make the final decision. To resolve policy conflicts at different ISP domains, a new secure infrastructure protocol (SIP) is developed to establish mutual trust or consensus. We simulated the DCD system up to 16 network domains on the Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research (DETER) testbed, a 220-node PC cluster for Internet emulation experiments at the University of Southern California (USC) Information Science Institute. Experimental results show that four network domains are sufficient to yield a 98 percent detection accuracy with only 1 percent false-positive alarms.

Past research proposed several architectural-level techniques to reduce disk power by taking advantage of idle periods experienced by disks. Although such techniques have been known to be effective in certain cases, they share a common drawback: they operate in a reactive manner, i.e., they control disk power by observing past disk activity (for example, idle and active periods) and estimating future ones. Consequently, they can miss opportunities for saving power and incur significant performance penalties due to inaccuracies in predicting idle and active times. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes and evaluates a compiler-driven approach to reducing disk power consumption of array-based scientific applications executing on parallel architectures. The proposed approach exposes disk layout information to the compiler, allowing it to derive the disk access pattern, i.e., the order in which parallel disks are accessed. This paper demonstrates two uses of this information. First, we can implement proactive disk power management, i.e., we can select the most appropriate power-saving strategy and disk-preactivation strategy based on the compiler-predicted future idle and active periods of parallel disks. Second, we can restructure the application code to increase the length of idle disk periods, which leads to better exploitation of available power-saving capabilities.

This innovative approach combines the advantages of both proxy caching and peer-to-peer client communications. It leverages the client-side caching to amplify the aggregated cache space and rely on dedicated proxies to effectively coordinate the communications. We propose a comprehensive suite of distributed protocols to facilitate the interactions among different network entities in COPACC. It also realizes a smart and cost-effective cache indexing, searching, and verifying scheme. Furthermore, we develop an efficient cache allocation algorithm for distributing video segments among the proxies and clients. The algorithm not only minimizes the aggregated transmission cost of the whole system, but also accommodates heterogeneous computation and storage constraints of proxies and clients. We have extensively evaluated the performance of COPACC under various network and end-system configurations. The results demonstrate that it achieves remarkably lower transmission cost as compared to pure proxy-based caching with limited storage space.

Moreover, conventional resource scheduling algorithms depend strongly upon the assumption of prior knowledge of network parameters and cannot handle variations or lack of information about these parameters. In this paper, we present a novel scheduler called the composite bandwidth and CPU scheduler (CBCS), which jointly allocates the fair share of the link bandwidth as well as processing resource to all competing flows.

We study such concerns by considering a group of independent, rational, self-aware nodes that cooperate using online caching algorithms, where the exposed resource is the storage at each node. Motivated by content networking applications - including Web caching, content delivery networks (CDNs), and peer-to-peer (P2P) - this paper extends our previous work on the offline version of the problem, which was conducted under a game-theoretic framework and limited to object replication. We identify and investigate two causes of mistreatment: 1) cache state interactions (due to the cooperative servicing of requests) and 2) the adoption of a common scheme for cache management policies. Using analytic models, numerical solutions of these models, and simulation experiments, we show that online cooperation schemes using caching are fairly robust to mistreatment caused by state interactions. To appear in a substantial manner, the interaction through the exchange of miss streams has to be very intense, making it feasible for the mistreated nodes to detect and react to exploitation. This robustness ceases to exist when nodes fetch and store objects in response to remote requests, that is, when they operate as level-2 caches (or proxies) for other nodes. Regarding mistreatment due to a common scheme, we show that this can easily take place when the """"outlier"""" characteristics of some of the nodes get overlooked. This finding underscores the importance of allowing cooperative caching nodes the flexibility of choosing from a diverse set of schemes to fit the peculiarities of individual nodes. To that end, we outline an emulation-based framework for the development of mistreatment-resilient distributed selfish caching schemes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.1076"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302725"","""",""Peer to peer computing";Costs;Protocols;Robustness;Cooperative caching;Numerical models;Analytical models;Scalability;"Routing"","""",""19"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""17 Sep 2007"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

SOAs have been employed within pervasive computing systems to provide essential support to user tasks by creating services representing the available resources. The mechanism of combining two or more basic services into a possibly complex service is known as service composition. Existing solutions to service composition employ a template-matching approach, where the user needs are expressed as a request template, and through composition, a system would identify services to populate the entities within the request template. However, with the dynamism involved in pervasive environments, the user needs have to be met by exploiting available resources, even when an exact match does not exist. In this paper, we present a novel service composition mechanism for pervasive computing. We employ the service-oriented middleware platform called Pervasive Information Communities Organization (PICO) to model and represent resources as services. The proposed service composition mechanism models services as directed attributed graphs, maintains a repository of service graphs, and dynamically combines multiple basic services into complex services. Further, we present a hierarchical overlay structure created among the devices to exploit the resource unevenness, resulting in the capability of providing essential service-related support to resource-poor devices.

When there is congestion, the main idea is to fairly reduce the CPU rates assigned to the tasks, so that the share of resources that each user gets is proportional to the user’s weight. The weight of a user may be defined as the user’s contribution to the infrastructure or the price he is willing to pay for services or any other socioeconomic consideration. In our algorithms, all tasks whose requirements are lower than their fair share CPU rate are served at their demanded CPU rates.

Most of today's routers and switches are implemented using single crossbar as the switched fabric. The single crossbar complexity increases at O(N2) in terms of crosspoint number, which might become unacceptable for scalability as the port number (N) increases. A delta class self-routing multistage interconnection network (MIN) with the complexity of O(N times log2N) has been widely used in the asynchronous transfer mode switches. However, the reduction of the crosspoint number results in considerable internal blocking. A number of scalable methods have been proposed to solve this problem. One of them uses more stages with recirculation architecture to reroute the deflected packets, which greatly increase the latency. In this paper, we propose an interleaved multistage switching fabrics architecture and assess its throughput with an analytical model and simulations. We compare this novel scheme with some previous parallel architectures and show its benefits. From extensive simulations under different traffic patterns and fault models, our interleaved architecture achieves better performance than its counterpart of single panel fabric.

Besides improving fault tolerance, the fact that GTSR makes packets take random paths from source to destination also improves security. In particular, it makes connection eavesdropping attacks maximally difficult as the attacker would have to listen on all possible routes. The approaches developed are suitable for network layer routing, as well as for application layer overlay routing and multipath transport protocols such as the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP).

In this paper, we introduce the idea of gradient boundary and propose the gradient boundary detection (GBD) algorithm to construct these time series snapshots of a monitored region. In GBD, a monitored region is partitioned into a set of subregions and all sensed data in one subregion are within a predefined value range, namely, the gradient interval.

Improperly designed reduction circuits can adversely impact the performance, impose unrealistic buffer requirements, and consume a significant portion of the FPGA. In this paper, we identify two basic methods for designing serial reduction circuits: the tree-traversal method and the striding method. Using accumulation as an example, we analyze the design trade-offs among the number of adders, buffer size, and latency. We then propose high-performance and area-efficient designs using each method.

AHMP dynamically applies multiple partitioners to different regions of the domain, in a hierarchical manner, to match the local requirements of the regions. Key components of the AHMP framework include a segmentation-based clustering algorithm (SBC) that can efficiently identify regions in the domain with relatively homogeneous partitioning requirements, mechanisms for characterizing the partitioning requirements of these regions, and a runtime system for selecting, configuring, and applying the most appropriate partitioner to each region. Further, to address dynamic resource situations for long-running applications, AHMP provides a hybrid partitioning strategy (HPS) that involves application-level pipelining, trading space for time when resources are sufficiently large and underutilized, and an application-level out-of-core strategy (ALOC), trading time for space when resources are scarce in order to enhance the survivability of applications.

For the first problem, we identify two layout schemes for the tree nodes, namely, the bandwidth-ordered tree and the time-ordered tree, which represent two typical approaches to improving tree reliability, and conduct a stochastic analysis on their properties regarding reliability and tree depth. Based on the findings, we propose a distributed reliability-oriented switching tree (ROST) algorithm that minimizes the failure correlation among tree nodes.

Such mapping for data distribution has an inherent load balance problem. Data redistribution algorithms based on randomized matching of heavily loaded nodes with light ones can deal with the dynamics of DHTs. However, they are unable to consider the proximity of the nodes simultaneously. There are other methods that rely on auxiliary networks to facilitate locality-aware load redistribution. Due to the cost of network construction and maintenance, the locality-aware algorithms can hardly work for DHTs with churn. This paper presents a locality-aware randomized load-balancing algorithm to deal with both the proximity and network churn at the same time. We introduce a factor of randomness in the probing of lightly loaded nodes in a range of proximity. We further improve the efficiency by allowing the probing of multiple candidates (d-way) at a time. Simulation results show the superiority of the locality-aware two-way randomized algorithm in comparison with other random or locality-aware algorithms.

The other is the mobility-assisted model, which considers mobility as a desirable feature, where routing is based on the store-carry-forward paradigm with random or controlled movement of mobile nodes (called ferries). It is well known that mobility increases the capacity of MANETs by reducing the number of relays in routing. Surprisingly, only two models, diameter hop count in the connection-based model and constant hop count in the mobility-assisted model, which correspond to two extremes of the spectrum, have been systematically studied.

The de facto standard, random early detection (RED), and many of its variants employ queue length as a congestion indicator to trigger packet dropping. Despite their simplicity, these approaches often suffer from unstable behaviors in a dynamic network. Adaptive parameter settings, though might solve the problem, remain difficult in such a complex system. Recent proposals based on analytical TCP control and AQM models suggest the use of both queue length and traffic input rate as congestion indicators, which effectively enhances stability. Their response time generally increases however, leading to frequent buffer overflow and emptiness. In this paper, we propose a novel AQM algorithm that achieves fast response time and yet good robustness. The algorithm, called Loss Ratio-based RED (LRED), measures the latest packet loss ratio, and uses it as a complement to queue length for adaptively adjusting the packet drop probability. We develop an analytical model for LRED, which demonstrates that LRED is responsive even if the number of TCP flows and their persisting times vary significantly. It also provides a general guideline for the parameter settings in LRED. The performance of LRED is further examined under various simulated network environments, and compared to existing AQM algorithms.

These applications also require that destinations receive the message from the source at approximately the same time. The problem of finding a multicasting subnetwork with delay and delay-variation bound has been proved to be an NP complete problem in the literature and heuristics have been proposed for this problem. In this paper, we provide an efficient heuristic to obtain a multicast subnetwork on an overlay network, given a source and a set of destinations that is within a specified maximum delay and a specified maximum variation in the delays from a source to the destinations.

In particular, the server activation time for class i is noninstantaneous. There are many systems and applications where a multiclass threshold-based queueing system can be of great use. One important utility of using threshold-based approaches is in situations where applications may incur server usage costs. In these cases, one needs to consider not only the performance aspects but also the resulting cost/performance ratio. The motivation for using hysteresis control is to reduce the unnecessary cost of server setup (or activation) and server removal (or deactivation) whenever there are momentary fluctuations in workload. Moreover, servers in such systems and applications are often needed by multiple classes of workloads and, hence, it is desirable to find good approaches to sharing server resources among the different classes of workloads, preferably without statically partitioning the server pool among these classes.

The LBA algorithm, which is applicable to small-scale systems (that is, intraGrid), performs load balancing by estimating the expected finish time of a job on buddy processors on each job arrival. Both algorithms estimate system parameters such as the job arrival rate, CPU processing rate, and load on the processor and balance the load by migrating jobs to buddy processors by taking into account the job transfer cost, resource heterogeneity, and network heterogeneity. We quantify the performance of our algorithms using several influencing parameters such as the job size, data transfer rate, status exchange period, and migration limit, and we discuss the implications of the performance and choice of our approaches."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.1115"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359403"",""Grid systems";load balancing;average response time;communication delays;migration;Grid systems;load balancing;average response time;communication delays;"migration"",""Algorithm design and analysis";Load management;Grid computing;Delay;Distributed computing;Scheduling algorithm;Costs;Resource management;Processor scheduling;"Heuristic algorithms"","""",""91"",""1"",""24"",""IEEE"",""5 Nov 2007"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

In this paper, we assume a wireless ad hoc network is represented by a Poisson point process with mean n on a unit-area disk, and nodes have the same maximal transmission radii. We give three asymptotic results on the length of the longest edge of the GG. First, we show that the ratio of the length of the longest edge to radic(ln n/pin)is asymptotically almost surely equal to 2. Next, we show that for any xi, the expected number of GG edges whose lengths are at least 2radic(ln n + xi/pin) is asymptotically equal to 2e middotxi.

The time-varying nature of the workload model further complicates the problem and necessitates an online capacity-estimation solution. To address this overprovisioning problem, we first define the capacity of a server cluster as the sustainable throughput subject to a request retransmission ratio constraint and then analyze different approaches to capacity estimation in a running system. Various capacity-estimation mechanisms, such as offline benchmarking and CPU-utilization evaluation, are discussed and compared with our queue-monitoring method. We employ several different data-collection methods (application instrumentation, user-space tools, simple network management protocol (SNMP), and kernel modules) to compare their effects on estimation accuracy. Of these, queue monitoring is found to provide a good and stable estimate of server capacity. To validate this finding, we propose a simple cluster- resizing mechanism and evaluate the energy-conservation performance. A good combination of data collection and online capacity estimation is found to make significantly more energy savings than traditional approaches (that is, static estimation and scheduled capacity).

In DCE, a program is first processed (speculatively) in the front processor and then reexecuted by the back processor. Such reexecution is the key to eliminating the centralized structures that are normally associated with very large instruction windows. In this paper, we exploit the computational redundancy in DCE to improve its reliability and its power efficiency.

State-of-the-art implementations execute two copies of the same program as two threads (redundant multithreading), either on the same or on separate processor cores in a CMP, and periodically check results. While this solution has favorable performance and reliability properties, every redundant instruction flows through a high-frequency complex outof- order pipeline, thereby incurring a high power consumption penalty.

We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured.

Availability and performance scalability, in terms of response time, are improved by aggressive replication, whereas resource constraints limit total storage in the network.

A mobile data observer, called SenCar, which could be a mobile robot or a vehicle equipped with a powerful transceiver and battery, works like a mobile base station in the network. SenCar starts the data gathering tour periodically from the static data processing center, traverses the entire sensor network, gathers the data from sensors while moving, returns to the starting point, and, finally, uploads data to the data processing center. Unlike SenCar, sensors in the network are static and can be made very simple and inexpensive. They upload sensed data to SenCar when SenCar moves close to them. Since sensors can only communicate with others within a very limited range, packets from some sensors may need multihop relays to reach SenCar. We first show that the moving path of SenCar can greatly affect network lifetime. We then present heuristic algorithms for planning the moving path/circle of SenCar and balancing traffic load in the network. We show that, by driving SenCar along a better path and balancing the traffic load from sensors to SenCar, network lifetime can be prolonged significantly. Our moving planning algorithm can be used in both connected networks and disconnected networks. In addition, SenCar can avoid obstacles while moving.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between predicate detection and computation slicing and show that the two problems are actually equivalent. Specifically, given an algorithm to detect a predicate b in a computation C, we derive an algorithm to compute the slice of C with respect to b.

In many cases, aggregate events provide insufficient information for programmers to understand and optimize the coherence behavior of their applications. A better understanding would be given by source code correlations of not only aggregate events, but also finer granularity metrics directly linked to high-level source code constructs, such as source lines and data structures. In this paper, we explore a novel application-centric approach to studying coherence traffic. We develop a coherence analysis framework based on incremental coherence simulation of actual reference traces. We provide tool support to extract these reference traces and synchronization information from OpenMP threads at runtime using dynamic binary rewriting of the application executable. These traces are fed to ccSIM, our cache-coherence simulator. The novelty of ccSIM lies in its ability to relate low-level cache coherence metrics (such as coherence misses and their causative invalidations) to high-level source code constructs including source code locations and data structures. We explore the degree of freedom in interleaving data traces from different processors and assess simulation accuracy in comparison to metrics obtained from hardware performance counters. Our quantitative results show that: 1) Cache coherence traffic can be simulated with a considerable degree of accuracy for SPMD programs, as the invalidation traffic closely matches the corresponding hardware performance counters. 2) Detailed, high-level coherence statistics are very useful in detecting, isolating, and understanding coherence bottlenecks.

Hence, we propose the use of resource control: increasing capacity by enabling more nodes to become active during periods of congestion. However, a naive approach to increase resources without a careful consideration of the type of congestion, traffic pattern, and network topology make the situation worse. In this paper, we present TARA, a topology-aware resource adaptation strategy to alleviate congestion.

It centers around a high-level domain-specific language, which makes it easy for a programmer to express, measure, and report the performance of complex communication patterns. The primary challenge in implementing a compiler for such a language is that the generated code must be extremely efficient so as not to misattribute overhead costs to the messaging library. At the same time, the language itself must not sacrifice expressiveness for compiler efficiency, or there would be little point in using a high-level language for performance testing. This paper describes the CONCEPTUAL language and the CONCEPTUAL compiler's novel code-generation framework. The language provides primitives for a wide variety of idioms needed for performance testing and emphasizes a readable syntax. The core code-generation technique, based on unrolling CONCEPTUAL programs into sequences of communication events, is simple yet enables the efficient implementation of a variety of high-level constructs.

In this paper, an adjustable structure, named the r-neighborhood graph, is proposed to control the topology. This structure has the flexibility to be adjusted between the two objectives through a parameter r, 0lesrles1. More explicitly, for any set of n nodes, the maximum node degree and power stretch factor can be bounded from above by some decreasing and increasing functions of r, respectively. Specifically, the bounds can be constants in some ranges of r. Even more, the r-neighborhood graph is a general structure of both RNG and GG, two well-known structures in topology control.

The multiplexing gain crucially depends on the size of the buffers available at the nodes of the network to store packets at the congested links. However, most of the previous work assumes the availability of infinite buffer-size. In this paper, we study the effect of finite buffer-size on the performance of networks of interacting queues. In particular, we study the throughput of flow-controlled loss-less networks with finite buffers. The main result of this paper is the characterization of a dynamic scheduling policy that achieves the maximal throughput with a minimal finite buffer at the internal nodes of the network under memory-less (e.g., Bernoulli IID) exogenous arrival process. However, this ideal performance policy is rather complex and, hence, difficult to implement. This leads us to the design of a simpler and possibly implementable policy.

We aim to provide a fundamental support for these applications - a real-time context information collection service. This service delivers the right context information to the right user at the right time. The complexity of providing the real-time context information service arises from 1) the dynamically changing status of information sources, 2) the diverse user requirements in terms of data accuracy and service latency, and 3) constantly changing system conditions. In this paper, we take into consideration these dynamics and focus on addressing the trade-offs between timeliness, accuracy, and cost for information collection in distributed real-time environments. We propose a middleware-based approach to enable a judicious composition of services for accuracy-aware scheduling and cost-aware database maintenance.

We propose a middleware framework for the real-time information collection process, where the information mediator coordinates and facilitates communication between information sources and consumers. We design a family of algorithms for real-time request scheduling, request servicing, and directory service maintenance to be implemented at the mediator to support QoSSat and QoDSat.

On the other hand, binary rewriting techniques have been advanced to allow users to enforce security policies directly on the mobile code. They have the advantages of supporting a richer set of security policies and a self-constrained written code. However, the high administrative and performance overhead caused by security configuration and code rewriting have prevented rewriters from becoming a practical security tool. In this paper, we address these problems by integrating binary code rewriters with Web caching proxies and build the security system called PB-JARS, a Proxy-based JAva Rewriting System. PB-JARS works as a complimentary system to existing JVM security mechanisms by placing another line of defense between users and their end-user systems. It gives system administrators centralized security control and management for the mobile code and security policies.
