First, admission control computation can overload a server that is already heavily loaded. Also, in large-scale media systems with geographically distributed server clusters, performing admission control on each cluster can result in long response latency, if the client request is denied at one site and has to be forwarded to another site. Furthermore, in prefix caching, initial frames cached at the proxy are delivered to the client before the admission decisions are made. If the media server is heavily loaded and, finally, has to deny the client request, forwarding a large number of initial frames is a waste of critical network resources. In this paper, a novel distributed admission control model is presented. We make use of proxy servers to perform the admission control tasks. Each proxy hosts an agent to coordinate the effort. Agents reserve media server's disk bandwidth and make admission decisions autonomously based on the allocated disk bandwidth. We develop an effective game theoretic framework to achieve fairness in the bandwidth allocation among the agents. To improve the overall bandwidth utilization, we also consider an aggressive admission control policy where each agent may admit more requests than its allocated bandwidth allows. The distributed admission control approach provides the solution to the stated problems incurred in conventional admission control models.

This paper describes a connectivity-based distributed node clustering scheme (CDC). This scheme presents a scalable and efficient solution for discovering connectivity-based clusters in peer networks. In contrast to centralized graph clustering algorithms, the CDC scheme is completely decentralized and it only assumes the knowledge of neighbor nodes instead of requiring a global knowledge of the network (graph) to be available. An important feature of the CDC scheme is its ability to cluster the entire network automatically or to discover clusters around a given set of nodes. To cope with the typical dynamics of P2P networks, we provide mechanisms to allow new nodes to be incorporated into appropriate existing clusters and to gracefully handle the departure of nodes in the clusters. These mechanisms enable the CDC scheme to be extensible and adaptable in the sense that the clustering structure of the network adjusts automatically as nodes join or leave the system. We provide detailed experimental evaluations of the CDC scheme, addressing its effectiveness in discovering good quality clusters and handling the node dynamics. We further study the types of topologies that can benefit best from the connectivity-based distributed clustering algorithms like CDC. Our experiments show that utilizing message-based connectivity structure can considerably reduce the messaging cost and provide better utilization of resources, which in turn improves the quality of service of the applications executing over decentralized peer-to-peer networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.101"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1490512"",""Distributed node clustering";connectivity-based graph clustering;peer-to-peer networks;"decentralized network management."",""Peer to peer computing";Intelligent networks;Sensor systems and applications;Clustering algorithms;Quality of service;Computer network management;Distributed computing;Ad hoc networks;Network topology;"Costs"","""",""77"",""2"",""42"",""IEEE"",""1 Aug 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dynamic network reconfiguration is defined as the process of changing from one routing function to another while the network remains up and running. The main challenge is in avoiding deadlock anomalies while keeping restrictions on packet injection and forwarding minimal. Current approaches either require virtual channels in the network or they work only for a limited set of routing algorithms and/or fault patterns. In this paper, we present a methodology for devising deadlock free and dynamic transitions between old and new routing functions that is consistent with newly proposed theory [J. Duato et al., (2005)]. The methodology is independent of topology, can be applied to any deadlock-free routing function, and puts no restrictions on the routing function changes that can be supported. Furthermore, it does not require any virtual channels to guarantee deadlock freedom.

A functional decomposition divides SDF into components that can be assigned to processing units, parallelizing the processing. The tessellation implicitly defines the set of tracks potentially yielding correlations with the sensor plots (observations) in a tile. Some tracks may occur as correlation candidates for multiple tiles. Conflicts caused by correlations of such tracks with plots in different tiles, are resolved by combining all involved tracks and plots into independent data association problems. The benefit of the TSDF approach to a clustering-based process distribution is independence of the problem space, which yields better scalability and manageability characteristics. The TSDF approach allows scaling in more than one way. It allows SDF for single sensor, multiple sensors on a single platform, and even for multiple sensors on multiple platforms. It also provides the flexibility to scale the processing to the size of the problem.

We first split and scatter the source message into the TSG of the original graph. Next, in each recursive round message transmissions are from lower-level TSGs to higher-level TSGs and all transmissions at the same level happen concurrently.

This work presents a scalable directory architecture that significantly reduces the size of the directory for large-scale configurations of a multiprocessor without degrading performance. First, we propose multilayer clustering as an effective approach to reduce the width of directory entries. Based on this concept, we derive three new compressed sharing codes, some of them with a space complexity of O(log/sub 2/(log/sub 2/(N))) for an N-node system. Then, we present a novel two-level directory architecture to eliminate the penalty caused by compressed directories in general. The proposed organization consists of a small full-map first-level directory (which provides precise information for the most recently referenced lines) and a compressed second-level directory (which provides in-excess information for all the lines). The proposals are evaluated based on extensive execution-driven simulations (using RSIM) of a 64-node cc-NUMA multiprocessor.

Because of their synchronization needs, these applications can suffer severe performance penalties if their processes are not all coscheduled to run together. Two common approaches to coscheduling jobs are batch scheduling, wherein nodes are dedicated for the duration of the run, and gang scheduling, wherein time slicing is coordinated across processors. Both work well when jobs are load-balanced and make use of the entire parallel machine. However, these conditions are rarely met and most realistic workloads consequently suffer from both internal and external fragmentation, in which resources and processors are left idle because jobs cannot be packed with perfect efficiency. This situation leads to reduced utilization and suboptimal performance. Flexible coscheduling (FCS) addresses this problem by monitoring each job's computation granularity and communication pattern and scheduling jobs based on their synchronization and load-balancing requirements. In particular, jobs that do not require stringent synchronization are identified, and are not coscheduled";" instead, these processes are used to reduce fragmentation. FCS has been fully implemented on top of the STORM resource manager on a 256-processor alpha cluster and compared to batch, gang, and implicit coscheduling algorithms. This paper describes in detail the implementation of FCS and its performance evaluation with a variety of workloads, including large-scale benchmarks, scientific applications, and dynamic workloads.

In macroscopic modeling, the load balancing mechanism is characterized using differential equations. We show that the load balancing we concern always converges to a steady state. Furthermore, we show that load balancing with different initial distributions converges to the same steady state gradually. Also, we prove that the steady state becomes an even distribution if and only if agents have complete knowledge about agent teams on minigrids. Utility gains and efficiency are introduced to measure the quality of load balancing. Through numerical simulations, we discuss the utility gains and efficiency of load balancing in different cases and give a series of analysis. In order to maximize the utility gain and the efficiency, we theoretically study the optimization of agents' strategies. Finally, in order to validate our proposed agent- based load balancing mechanism, we develop a computing platform, called simulation system for grid task distribution (SSGTD).

First, we present an aggregation tree for sequential (and parallel) data cube construction, which has minimally bounded memory requirements. An aggregation tree is parameterized by the ordering of dimensions. We present a parallel algorithm based upon the aggregation tree. We analyze the interprocessor communication volume and construct a closed form expression for it. We prove that the same ordering of the dimensions in the aggregation tree minimizes both the computational and communication requirements. We also describe a method for partitioning the initial array and prove that it minimizes the communication volume.

Hence, contention for communication resources is not considered in task scheduling, yet it has a strong influence on the execution time of a parallel program. This paper investigates the incorporation of contention awareness into task scheduling. A new system model for task scheduling is proposed, allowing us to capture both end-point and network contention. To achieve this, the communication network is reflected by a topology graph for the representation of arbitrary static and dynamic networks. The contention awareness is accomplished by scheduling the communications, represented by the edges in the task graph, onto the links of the topology graph. Edge scheduling is theoretically analyzed, including aspects like heterogeneity, routing, and causality. The proposed contention-aware scheduling preserves the theoretical basis of task scheduling. It is shown how classic list scheduling is easily extended to this more accurate system model.

As optics becomes a major networking media in all communications needs, optical interconnects will inevitably play an important role in interconnecting processors in parallel and distributed computing systems. We consider a cost-effective design of WDM optical interconnects for current and future generation parallel and distributed computing and communication systems. We first categorize WDM optical interconnects into two different connection models based on their target applications: the wavelength-based model and the fiber-link-based model. Most of existing WDM optical interconnects belong to the first category. We then present a minimum cost design for WDM optical interconnects under wavelength-based model by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters. For applications that use the fiber-link-based model, we show that network cost can be significantly reduced, and present such a minimum cost design for WDM optical interconnects under this model. Finally, we generalize the idea used in the design for the fiber-link-based model to WDM optical interconnects under the wavelength-based model, and obtain another new design that can trade off switch cost with wavelength converter cost in this type of WDM optical interconnect.

In fact, the performance of software schemes is highly dependent on application characteristics, the design and implementation of the scheme, and the system configuration and size. This paper explores the design space of a recently proposed software speculative parallelization scheme. In the process, we gain insight into the most beneficial features of software schemes for speculative parallelization, as well as the most influential application characteristics. For instance, experimental results show that, contrary to intuition, checking for data dependence violations on every speculative store, as opposed to at commit time, leads to little performance degradation in the worst case and to significantly better performance with large configurations. Also, scheduling policies based on windows can perform very close to fully dynamic policies with a fraction of the memory overhead.

Many issues are involved to provide quality of service (QoS) for ad hoc networks, including routing, medium access, resource reservation, mobility management, etc. Previous work mostly focuses on QoS routing with an assumption that the medium access control (MAC) layer can support QoS very well. However, contention-based MAC protocols are adopted in most ad hoc networks since there is no centralized control. QoS support in contention-based MAC layer is a very challenging issue. Carefully designed distributed medium access techniques must be used as foundations for most ad hoc networks. In this paper, we study and enhance distributed medium access techniques for real-time transmissions in the IEEE 802.11 single-hop ad hoc wireless networks. In the IEEE 802.11 MAC, error control adopts positive acknowledgement and retransmission to improve transmission reliability in the wireless medium (WM). However, for real-time multimedia traffic with sensitive delay requirements, retransmitted frames may be too late to be useful due to the fact that the delay of competing the WM is unpredictable. In this paper, we address several MAC issues and QoS issues for delay-sensitive real-time traffic. First, a priority scheme is proposed to differentiate the delay sensitive real-time traffic from the best-effort traffic. In the proposed priority scheme, retransmission is not used for the real-time traffic, and a smaller backoff window size is adopted. Second, we propose several schemes to guarantee QoS requirements. The first scheme is to guarantee frame-dropping probability for the real-time traffic. The second scheme is to guarantee throughput and delay. The last scheme is to guarantee throughput, delay, and frame-dropping probability simultaneously.

In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for detecting and resolving network congestion and potential deadlocks. The proposed mechanism is based on efficiently tracking paths of congestion and increasing the scheduling priority of packets along those paths. This acts to throttle other packets trying to enter those congested regions - in effect, locking out packets from congested regions until congestion has had the opportunity to disperse. Simulation results show that the proposed technique effectively disperses network congestion and is also applicable in helping to resolve potential deadlock."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.93"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458685"",""Interconnection networks";congestion;deadlock;router scheduling;"router architecture."",""System recovery";Dispersion;Routing;Processor scheduling;Telecommunication network reliability;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;System performance;Computer networks;Distributed computing;"High performance computing"","""",""11"",""2"",""44"",""IEEE"",""27 Jun 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, the lack of an appropriate size ratio maintenance mechanism on superlayer to leaf-layer makes the system's search performance far from being optimal. We present one workload model aimed at reducing the weighted overhead of a network. Using our proposed workload model, a network can determine an optimal layer size ratio between leaf-layer and superlayer. We then propose a dynamic layer management algorithm, DLM, which can maintain an optimal layer size ratio and adaptively elect and adjust peers between superlayer and leaf-layer. DLM is completely distributed in the sense that each peer decides to be a superpeer or a leaf-peer independently without global knowledge. DLM could effectively help a superpeer P2P system maintain the optimal layer size ratio and designate peers with relatively long lifetime and large capacities as superpeers, and the peers with short lifetime and low capacities as leaf-peers under highly dynamic network situations.

While recent feedback control real-time scheduling algorithms have shown promise, they cannot handle the common end-to-end task model where each task is comprised of a chain of subtasks distributed on multiple processors. This paper presents the end-to-end utilization control (EUCON) algorithm that adaptively maintains desired CPU utilization through performance feedbacks loops.

Since performance predictability is essential to provide QoS service, underlying systems must provide predictable performance guarantees. One way to ensure such guarantees from network subsystems is to generate global schedules from applications' network requests and to execute the local portion of the schedules at each network interface. To ensure accurate execution of the schedules, it is essential that a global time base must be maintained by local clocks at each network interface. The task of providing a single time base is called a synchronization problem and this paper addresses the problem for system area networks. To solve the synchronization problem, FM-QoS [K. Connelly (1999)] proposed a simple synchronization mechanism called FBS (feedback-based synchronization) which uses built-in flow control signals. This paper extends the basic notion of FM-QoS to a theoretical framework and generalizes it: 1) to identify a set of built-in network flow control signals for synchrony and to formalize it as a synchronizing schedule and 2) to analyze the synchronization precision of FBS in terms of flow control parameters. Based on generalization, two application classes are studied for a single switch network and a multiple switch network. For each class, a synchronizing schedule is proposed and its bounded skew is analyzed. Unlike FM-QoS, the synchronizing schedule is proven to minimize the bounded skew value for a single switch network. To understand the analysis results in practical networks, skew values are obtained with flow control parameters of Myrinet-2000. We observed that the maximum bounded skew of FBS is 5.79/spl mu/sec or less over all our experiments. Based on this result, we came to a conclusion that FBS was a feasible synchronization mechanism in system area networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.122"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1501803"",""Synchronization";link level flow control;system area networks;"cluster computing."",""Computer networks";Synchronization;Switches;Quality of service;Processor scheduling;Network interfaces;Computer applications;Clocks;Signal processing;"Signal analysis"","""",""3"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""29 Aug 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But, there are exceptions where some tasks can be assigned to one of several processors without altering the total volume of communication. In this paper, we study the problem of exploiting this flexibility in assignment of tasks to improve load balance. We first model the problem in terms of network flow and use combinatorial techniques for its solution. Our parametric search algorithms use maximum flow algorithms for probing on a candidate optimal solution value. We describe two algorithms to solve the assignment problem with log W/sub T/ and |P| probe calls, where W/sub T/ and |P|, respectively, denote the total workload and number of processors. We also define augmenting paths and cuts for this problem, and show that any algorithm based on augmenting paths can be used to find an optimal solution for the task assignment problem. We then consider a continuous version of the problem and formulate it as a linearly constrained optimization problem, i.e., min /spl par/Ax/spl par//spl infin/, s.t. Bx=d. To avoid solving an intractable /spl infin/-norm optimization problem, we show that, in this case, minimizing the 2-norm is sufficient to minimize the /spl infin/-norm, which reduces the problem to the well-studied linearly constrained least squares problem. The continuous version of the problem has the advantage of being easily amenable to parallelization.

These systems allow multiple users, working on different client computers that are interconnected through different networks, to interact in a shared virtual world. One of the key issues in the design of scalable and cost-effective DVE systems is the partitioning problem. This problem consists of efficiently assigning the existing clients to the servers in the system and some techniques have been already proposed for solving it. This paper experimentally analyzes the correlation of the quality function proposed in the literature for solving the partitioning problem with the performance of DVE systems. Since the results show an absence of correlation, we also propose the experimental characterization of DVE systems. The results show that the reason for that absence of correlation is the nonlinear behavior of DVE systems with regard to the number of clients in the system. DVE systems reach saturation when any of the servers reaches 100 percent of CPU utilization. The system performance greatly decreases if this limit is exceeded in any server. Also, as a direct application of these results, we present a partitioning method that is targeted to keep all the servers in the system below a certain threshold value of CPU utilization, regardless of the amount of network traffic. Evaluation results show that the proposed partitioning method can improve DVE system performance, regardless of both the movement pattern of clients and the initial distribution of clients in the virtual world."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.83"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435341"",""Distributed applications";"distributed/network graphics."",""Virtual environment";Avatars;Military computing;Network servers;System performance;Computer networks;Central Processing Unit;Telecommunication traffic;Graphics;"Rendering (computer graphics)"","""",""54"",""1"",""42"",""IEEE"",""31 May 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, without circumspect design, the integration of these two techniques might cause significant performance degradation to each other. In view of this, we propose in this paper an innovative cache replacement algorithm, which not only considers the caching effect in the Web environment, but also evaluates the prefetching rules provided by various prefetching schemes. Specifically, we formulate a normalized profit function to evaluate the profit from caching an object (i.e., either a nonimplied object or an implied object according to some prefetching rule).

The novel premise in iterative adaptation is that these APIs are sufficient to support a wide range of adaptation policies for applications running on resource-limited devices. In addition to allowing adaptation without having to change the application's source code, this approach has a unique combination of advantages. First, it supports centralized management of resources across multiple applications. Second, it makes it possible to modify application behavior after the application has been deployed. This paper evaluates the extent to which existing APIs can be used for the purposes of adapting document-based applications to run on bandwidth-limited devices. In particular, we implement a large number of bandwidth adaptations for applications from the Microsoft Office and the OpenOffice productivity suites and for Internet Explorer. Although we find limitations in their APIs, we are able to implement many adaptation policies without much complexity and with good performance.

In current processors, the translation is done in a TLB (translation lookaside buffer), before or in parallel with the first-level cache access. As processor technology improves at a rapid pace and the working sets of new applications grow insatiably, the latency and bandwidth demands on the TLB are difficult to meet, especially in multiprocessor systems, which run larger applications and are plagued by the TLB consistency problem. We describe and compare five options for virtual address translation in the context of distributed shared memory (DSM) multiprocessors, including CC-NUMAs (cache-coherent non-uniform memory access architectures) and COMAs (cache only memory access architectures). In CC-NUMAs, moving the TLB to shared memory is a bad idea because page placement, migration, and replication are all constrained by the virtual page address, which greatly affects processor node access locality. In the context of COMAs, the allocation of pages to processor nodes is not as critical because memory blocks can dynamically migrate and replicate freely among nodes. As the address translation is done deeper in the memory hierarchy, the frequency of translations drops because of the filtering effect. We also observe that the TLB is very effective when it is merged with the shared-memory, because of the sharing and prefetching effects and because there is no need to maintain TLB consistency. Even if the effectiveness of the TLB merged with the shared memory is very high, we also show that the TLB can be removed in a system with address translation done in memory because the frequency of translations is very low."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.84"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435339"",""Multiprocessors";distributed shared memory;virtual memory;simulations;dynamic address translation;"virtual-address caches."",""Memory architecture";Delay;Bandwidth;Space technology;Multiprocessing systems;Frequency;Scalability;Large-scale systems;Filtering;"Prefetching"","""",""11"",""1"",""40"",""IEEE"",""31 May 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This trend is exemplified by the growing number of network-on-chip (NoC) architectures that have been proposed recently for system-on-chip (SoC) integration. Developing NoC-based systems tailored to a particular application domain is crucial for achieving high-performance, energy-efficient customized solutions. The effectiveness of this approach largely depends on the availability of an ad hoc design methodology that, starting from a high-level application specification, derives an optimized NoC configuration with respect to different design objectives and instantiates the selected application specific on-chip micronetwork. Automatic execution of these design steps is highly desirable to increase SoC design productivity. This work illustrates a complete synthesis flow, called Netchip, for customized NoC architectures, that partitions the development work into major steps (topology mapping, selection, and generation) and provides proper tools for their automatic execution (SUNMAP, xpipescompiler). The entire flow leverages the flexibility of a fully reusable and scalable network components library called xpipes, consisting of highly-parameterizable network building blocks (network interface, switches, switch-to-switch links) that are design-time tunable and composable to achieve arbitrary topologies and customized domain-specific NoC architectures.

By using multiple spatially distributed servers, we are able to exploit slow connections that would otherwise prevent the deployment of video-on-demand-like services, to offer such services in an optimal manner. Additionally, the delivery and playback schedule that is computed by our approach is loss-aware in the sense that it is flexible enough to accommodate packet losses without interrupts. The mathematical framework presented covers both computation and optimization problems associated with the delivery schedule, offering a complete set of guidelines for designing MSMI VoD services. The optimizations presented include the ordering of the servers and determining the number of installments based on the packet-loss probabilities of the communication links.

In particular, compiling a given application code under performance and energy constraints is becoming an important problem. In this paper, we focus on an on-chip multiprocessor architecture and present a set of code optimization strategies. We first evaluate an adaptive loop parallelization strategy (i.e., a strategy that allows each loop nest to execute using a different number of processors if doing so is beneficial) and measure the potential energy savings when unused processors during execution of a nested loop are shut down (i.e., placed into a power-down or sleep state). Our results show that shutting down unused processors can lead to as much as 67 percent energy savings at the expense of up to 17 percent performance loss in a set of array-intensive applications. To eliminate this performance penalty, we also discuss and evaluate a processor preactivation strategy based on compile-time analysis of nested loops. Based on our experiments, we conclude that an adaptive loop parallelization strategy combined with idle processor shut down and preactivation can be very effective in reducing energy consumption without increasing execution time. We then generalize our strategy and present an application parallelization strategy based on integer linear programming (ILP). Given an array-intensive application, our optimization strategy determines the number of processors to be used in executing each loop nest based on the objective function and additional compilation constraints provided by the user/programmer. Our initial experience with this constraint-based optimization strategy shows that it is very successful in optimizing array-intensive applications on on-chip multiprocessors under multiple energy and performance constraints."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.57"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411729"",""On-chip multiprocessor";constrained optimization;embedded systems;energy consumption;adaptive loop parallelization;"integer linear programming."",""Constraint optimization";Application software;Energy consumption;Design optimization;Computer architecture;Energy measurement;Potential energy;Sleep;Performance loss;"Performance analysis"","""",""9"","""",""54"",""IEEE"",""4 Apr 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we determine the conditions under which a provider's participation in a collective reduces the rejection rate of requests for its content - a property that is necessary for such a provider to justify its participation within the collective. We show that all request rejection rates are reduced when the collective is formed from a homogeneous set of providers, but that some rates can increase within heterogeneous sets. We also show that, asymptotically, growing the size of the collective will sometimes, but not always, resolve this problem. We explore the use of thresholding techniques, where each collective participant sets aside a portion of its serving resources to serve only requests for its own content.

In this paper, we implement and evaluate deadlock-free routings and unicast-based multicasts under various topologies and channel buffer sizes on a PC cluster called RHiNET-2 with 64 hosts.

With regard to the processor allocation, PDPA is a dynamic policy that allocates to applications the maximum number of processors to reach a given target efficiency. With regard to the multiprogramming level, PDPA allows the execution of a new application when free processors are available and the allocation of all the running applications is stable, or if some applications show bad performance. Results demonstrate that PDPA automatically adjusts the processor allocation of parallel applications to reach the specified target efficiency, and that it adjusts the multiprogramming level to the workload characteristics.

The anonymity allowed by IP networking, together with the distributed, large scale nature of the Internet, makes DDoS attacks stealthy and difficult to counter. To make the problem worse, attack traffic is often indistinguishable from normal traffic. As various attack tools become widely available and require minimum knowledge to operate, automated antiDDoS systems become increasingly important. Many current solutions are either excessively expensive or require universal deployment across many administrative domains. This paper proposes two perimeter-based defense mechanisms for Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide the antiDDoS service to their customers. These mechanisms rely completely on the edge routers to cooperatively identify the flooding sources and establish rate-limit filters to block the attack traffic. The system does not require any support from routers outside or inside of the ISP, which not only makes it locally deployable, but also avoids the stress on the ISP core routers. We also study a new problem of perimeter-based IP traceback and provide three solutions. We demonstrate analytically and by simulations that the proposed defense mechanisms react quickly in blocking attack traffic while achieving high survival ratio for legitimate traffic. Even when 40 percent of all customer networks attack, the survival ratio for traffic from the other customer networks is still close to 100 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.74"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425441"",""Network-level security and protection."",""Bandwidth";Computer crime;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services;Availability;Large-scale systems;IP networks;Counting circuits;"Floods"","""",""51"","""",""21"",""IEEE"",""2 May 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We assume that there is a large number of messages to be broadcast in pipeline fashion, and we aim at maximizing the throughput, i.e., the (rational) number of messages which can be broadcast every time-step. We target heterogeneous platforms, modeled by a graph where resources have different communication and computation speeds. Achieving the best throughput may well require that the target platform is used in totality: we show that neither spanning trees nor DAGs are as powerful as general graphs. We show how to compute the best throughput using linear programming, and how to exhibit a periodic schedule, first when restricting to a DAG, and then when using a general graph. The polynomial compactness of the description comes from the decomposition of the schedule into several broadcast trees that are used concurrently to reach the best throughput.

Next, we compare PRESS to servers that involve less intercluster communication, but are not as easily portable. Our results for an 8-node server cluster and five WWW traces demonstrate that user-level communication can improve performance by as much as 52 percent compared to a kernel-level protocol.

We show that the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-aware services is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms for fast computation of good solutions are proposed and experimentally evaluated.

In the second phase, evaluators use an analytical model to combine an expected fault load with measurements from the first phase to assess the service's performability. Using this model, evaluators can study the service's sensitivity to different design decisions, fault rates, and other environmental factors. To demonstrate our methodology, we study the performability of a multitier Internet service. In particular, we evaluate the performance and availability of three soft state maintenance strategies for an online bookstore service in the presence of seven classes of faults. Among other interesting results, we clearly isolate the effect of different faults, showing that the tier of Web servers is responsible for an often dominant fraction of the service unavailability. Our results also demonstrate that storing the soft state in a database achieves better performability than storing it in main memory (even when the state is efficiently replicated) when we weight performance and availability equally.

We present a programming model that allows us to decompose database queries into simple operations. These operations are then distributed and executed by the different layers of the hierarchy depending on the affinity of the task to a particular layer. Commands percolate down into the lower layers of the hierarchy and partially processed information flows up into the higher layers, where subsequent operations can be performed. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical computing model by performing full system simulations of a business decision support system (DSS) workload. On a group of TPC-H-like queries, hierarchical computing systems reduce the amount of data transferred over the processor to memory interconnect by 37-58 percent.

Node-disjoint routing has important applications in guided wave optical interconnects where the optical """"crosstalk"""" between messages passing the same switch should be avoided. In this paper, we consider routing arbitrary permutations on an optical baseline network (or reverse baseline network) with node-disjoint paths. We first prove the equivalence between the set of admissible permutations (or semipermutations) of a baseline network and that of its reverse network based on a step-by-step permutation routing. We then show that an arbitrary permutation can be realized in a baseline network (or a reverse baseline network) with node-disjoint paths in four passes, which beats the existing results [M. Vaez et al., (2000)], [G. Maier et al., (2001)] that a permutation can be realized in an n /spl times/ n banyan network with node-disjoint paths in O(n/sup 1/2/) passes. This represents the currently best-known result for the number of passes required for routing an arbitrary permutation with node-disjoint paths in unique-path multistage networks. Unlike other unique path MINs (such as omega networks or banyan networks), only baseline networks have been found to possess such four-pass routing property. We present routing algorithms in both self-routing style and central-controlled style. Different from the recent work in [Y. Yang et al., (2003)], which also gave a four-pass node-disjoint routing algorithm for permutations, the new algorithm is efficient in transmission time for messages of any length, while the algorithm in [Y.

A common form of decentralization adopted in processors is to partition the execution core into multiple clusters. Each cluster has a small instruction window, and a set of functional units. A number of algorithms have been proposed for distributing instructions among the clusters. The first part of this paper analyzes (qualitatively as well as quantitatively) the effect of various hardware parameters such as the type of cluster interconnect, the fetch size, the cluster issue width, the cluster window size, and the number of clusters on the performance of different instruction distribution algorithms. The study shows that the relative performance of the algorithms is very sensitive to these hardware parameters and that the algorithms that perform relatively better with four or fewer clusters are generally not the best ones for a larger number of clusters. This is important, given that with an imminent increase in the transistor budget, more clusters are expected to be integrated on a single chip. The second part of the paper investigates alternate interconnects that provide scalable performance as the number of clusters is increased. In particular, it investigates two hierarchical interconnects - a single ring of crossbars and multiple rings of crossbars - as well as instruction distribution algorithms to take advantage of these interconnects. Our study shows that these new interconnects with the appropriate distribution techniques achieve an IPC (instructions per cycle) that is 15-20 percent better than the most scalable existing configuration, and is within 2 percent of that achieved by a hypothetical ideal processor having a 1-cycle latency crossbar interconnect. These results confirm the utility and applicability of hierarchical interconnects and hierarchical distribution algorithms in clustered processors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.128"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1501806"",""Clustered processor architecture";pipeline processors;interconnection architectures;"load balancing and task assignment."",""Scalability";Clustering algorithms;Delay;Wires;Partitioning algorithms;Hardware;Computer Society;Algorithm design and analysis;Process design;"Performance analysis"","""",""3"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""29 Aug 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Previous superscalar designs implemented this interconnect using centralized structures that do not scale with increasing ILP demands. In search of scalability, recent microprocessor designs in industry and academia exhibit a trend toward distributed resources such as partitioned register files, banked caches, multiple independent compute pipelines, and even multiple program counters. Some of these partitioned microprocessor designs have begun to implement bypassing and operand transport using point-to-point interconnects. We call interconnects optimized for scalar data transport, whether centralized or distributed, scalar operand networks. Although these networks share many of the challenges of multiprocessor networks such as scalability and deadlock avoidance, they have many unique requirements, including ultra-low latency (a few cycles versus tens of cycles) and ultra-fast operation-operand matching. This work discusses the unique properties of scalar operand networks (SONs), examines alternative ways of implementing them, and introduces the AsTrO taxonomy to distinguish between them.

By employing the data allocation algorithms devised, the occurrences of costly remote accesses can be minimized and the performance of a mobile computing system is thus improved. The data allocation algorithms for shared data, which are able to achieve local optimization and global optimization, are developed. Local optimization refers to the optimization that the likelihood of local data access by an individual mobile user is maximized whereas global optimization refers to the optimization that the likelihood of local data access by all mobile users is maximized. Specifically, by exploring the features of local optimization and global optimization, we devise algorithm SD-local and algorithm SD-global to achieve local optimization and global optimization, respectively. In general, the mobile users are divided into two types, namely, frequently moving users and infrequently moving users. A measurement, called closeness measure which corresponds to the amount of the intersection between the set of frequently moving user patterns and that of infrequently moving user patterns, is derived to assess the quality of solutions provided by SD-local and SD-global. Performance of these data allocation algorithms is comparatively analyzed. From the analysis of SD-local and SD-global, it is shown that SD-local favors infrequently moving users whereas SD-global is good for frequently moving users.

We find that incorrect speculation (wrong execution) on the instruction and thread-level provides an indirect prefetching effect for the later correct execution paths and threads. By continuing to execute the mispredicted load instructions even after the instruction or thread-level control speculation is known to be incorrect, the cache misses observed on the correctly executed paths can be reduced by 16 to 73 percent, with an average reduction of 45 percent.

The multimedia router (MMR) aims at offering hardware-based QoS support within a compact interconnection component.

More specifically, we examine how Vl-based interconnects can be used to improve I/O path performance between a database server and a storage subsystem. To facilitate the interaction between client applications and a Vl-aware storage system, we design and implement a software layer called DSA, that is layered between applications and VI. DSA takes advantage of specific VI features and deals with many of its shortcomings. We provide and evaluate one kernel-level and two user-level implementations of DSA. These implementations trade transparency and generality for performance at different degrees and, unlike research prototypes, are designed to be suitable for real-world deployment. We have also investigated many design trade offs in the storage cluster. We present detailed measurements using a commercial database management system with both microbenchmarks and industrial database workloads on a mid-size, 4 CPU, and a large, 32 CPU, database server. We also compare the effectiveness of Vl-attached storage with an iSCSI configuration, and conclude that storage protocols implemented using DSA over VI have significant performance advantages. More generally, our results show that Vl-based interconnects and user-level communication can improve all aspects of the I/O path between the database system and the storage back-end. We also find that to make effective use of VI in I/O intensive environments, we need to provide substantial additional functionality than what is currently provided by VI. Finally, new storage APIs that help minimize kernel involvement in the I/O path are needed to fully exploit the benefits of Vl-based communication."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.13"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1363751"",""Database storage";storage server;Virtual Interface;user-level communication;performance evaluation;"server cluster."",""Database systems";Transaction databases;Scalability;Costs;Operating systems;Network servers;Application software;Computer architecture;Spatial databases;"Prototypes"","""",""4"","""",""42"",""IEEE"",""17 Jan 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The proposed scheduling policy, ADAPTLOAD, monitors the incoming workload and self-adjusts its balancing parameters according to changes in the operational environment such as rapid fluctuations in the arrival rates or document popularity. Using actual traces from the 1998 World Cup Web site, we conduct a detailed characterization of the workload demands and demonstrate how online workload monitoring can play a significant part in meeting the performance challenges of robust policy design. We show that the proposed load, balancing policy based on statistical information derived from recent workload history provides similar performance benefits as locality-aware allocation schemes, without requiring locality data. Extensive experimentation indicates that ADAPTLOAD results in an effective scheme, even when servers must support both static and dynamic Web pages."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.38"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388212"",""Clustered Web servers";self-managing clusters;load balance;locality awareness;workload characterization;"static and dynamic pages."",""Load management";Web server;Vehicle dynamics;Switches;Robustness;Availability;Service oriented architecture;Scalability;Internet;"Sun"","""",""89"",""1"",""26"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of increased sophistication and severity of these attacks, the system administrator of a victim site needs to quickly and accurately identify the probable attackers and eliminate the attack traffic. Our work is based on a probabilistic marking algorithm in which an attack graph can be constructed by a victim site. We extend the basic concept such that one can quickly and efficiently deduce the intensity of the """"local traffic"""" generated at each router in the attack graph based on the volume of received marked packets at the victim site. Given the intensities of these local traffic rates, we can rank the local traffic and identify the network domains generating most of the attack traffic. We present our trace back and attacker identification algorithms. We also provide a theoretical framework to determine the minimum stable time t/sub min/, which is the minimum time needed to accurately determine the locations of attackers and local traffic rates of participating routers in the attack graph. Extensive experiments are carried out to illustrate that one can accurately determine the minimum stable time t/sub min/ and, at the same time, determine the location of attackers under various threshold parameters, network diameters, attack traffic distributions, on/off patterns, and network traffic conditions."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2005.114"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1490511"",""DDoS attack";traceback;attack traffic filtering;"minimum stable time."",""Statistical analysis";Computer crime;Telecommunication traffic;Information filtering;Information filters;IP networks;Frequency;Large-scale systems;"Internet"","""",""42"",""1"",""22"",""IEEE"",""1 Aug 2005"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
