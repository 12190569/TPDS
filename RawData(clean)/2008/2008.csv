On-demand streaming with asynchronous requests and, in general, with VCR-like interactions nevertheless remains a challenging task in overlay networks. In this paper, we introduce the dynamic skip list (DSL), a novel randomized and distributed structure that inherently accommodates dynamic and asynchronous clients. We establish the theoretical foundations of the DSL and demonstrate a practical DSL-based streaming overlay. In this overlay, the costs for typical operations, including join, leave, fast-forward, rewind, and random seek, are all sublinear to the client population. The model also seamlessly integrates a smart data scheduling algorithm using linear network coding, yielding fast and robust downloading from multiple suppliers. Our simulation results show that the DSL-based overlay is highly scalable. It delivers reasonably smooth playback with diverse client interactivities while keeping the computation and bandwidth overheads low."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70748"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359437"",""Applications";Protocol architecture;Applications;"Protocol architecture"",""Streaming media";Video recording;Peer to peer computing;DSL;Vehicle dynamics;Costs;Scheduling algorithm;Robustness;Collaboration;"Indexing"","""",""48"","""",""38"",""IEEE"",""3 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, they either cannot offer strong resilience against node capture attacks, or require too much memory for achieving the desired connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel key management scheme using deployment knowledge. In our scheme, a target field is divided into a number of hexagon grids and sensor nodes are divided into the same number of groups as that of grids, where each group is deployed into a unique grid. By using deployment knowledge, we drastically reduce the number of potential groups from which a node's neighbors may come. Thus, a pairwise key can be generated efficiently for any two neighbor nodes.

Two kinds of IP traceback techniques have been proposed as packet marking and packet logging. In packet marking, routers probabilistically write their identification information into forwarded packets. This approach incurs little overhead but requires large flow of packets to collect the complete path information. In packet logging, routers record digests of the forwarded packets. This approach makes it possible to trace a single packet and is considered more powerful. At routers forwarding large volume of traffic, the high storage overhead and access time requirement for recording packet digests introduce practicality problems. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to improve the practicality of log-based IP traceback by reducing its overhead on routers. Our approach makes an intelligent use of packet marking to improve scalability of log-based IP traceback. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach.

In this paper, we propose a new state transitionscheme , called the Duplication-based State Transition (DST) method specially designed for metaheuristics that can be used for the task scheduling problem in heterogeneous computing environments. State transition in metaheuristics is a key component that takes charge of generating variants of a given state. The DST method produces a new state by first overlapping randomly generated states with the current state and then the resultant state is refined by removing ineffectual tasks. The proposed method is incorporated into three different metaheuristics: genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated annealing (SA), and artificial immune system (AISs).

Traditional multicast protocols construct and update the multicast tree in a distributed manner, which may cause two problems: first, since each node has only local or partial information on the network topology and group membership, it is difficult to build an efficient multicast tree";" second, due to lack of complete information, broadcast is often used for sending control packets and data packets, which consumes a great deal of network bandwidth. In the newly proposed multicast architecture, a few powerful routers, called m-routers, collect multicast-related information and process multicast requests based on the information collected. The m-routers handle most of multicast related tasks, while other routers in the network only need to perform minimum functions for routing. The m-routers are designed to be able to handle simultaneous many-to-many communications efficiently. The new multicast routing protocol, called the Service Centric Multicast Protocol (SCMP), builds a shared multicast tree rooted at the m-router for each group. The multicast tree is computed in the m-router by employing the Delay Constrained Dynamic Multicast (DCDM) algorithm which dynamically builds a delay constrained multicast tree and minimizes the tree cost as well. The physical construction of the multicast tree over the Internet is performed by a special type of self-routing packets in order to minimize the protocol overhead.

We show that a single node accelerated with reconfigurable hardware, utilizing fine-grained parallelism in the reconfigurable hardware design, is able to achieve a speedup of about two times over the corresponding software-only simulation. We then parallelize the application and study the effect of acceleration on performance and scalability. Specifically, we study strong scaling, in which the problem size is fixed. We find that the unaccelerated version actually scales better, because it spends more time in computation than the accelerated version does. However, we also find that a cluster of P accelerated nodes gives better performance than a cluster of 2P unaccelerated nodes."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70777"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359457"",""Reconfigurable hardware";Distributed architectures;Physics;Chemistry;Reconfigurable hardware;Distributed architectures;Physics;"Chemistry"",""Acceleration";Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Hardware;Application software;Field programmable gate arrays;Computer networks;Scientific computing;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;"Parallel processing"","""",""29"",""1"",""52"",""IEEE"",""25 Apr 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper investigates data collection strategies in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks. Our objective is to maximize the accuracy of data collected by the base station over the network lifetime. Instead of sending sensor readings periodically, the relative importance of the readings is considered in data collection: the sensor nodes send data updates to the base station when the new readings differ more substantially from the previous ones. We analyze the optimal update strategy and develop adaptive update strategies for both individual and aggregate data collections. We also present two methods to cope with message losses in wireless transmission. To make full use of the energy budgets, we design an algorithm to allocate the numbers of updates allowed to be sent by the sensor nodes based on their topological relations.

In an effort to better link these resources in a unified manner, many lambda-grid networks, which provide end-to-end dedicated optical-circuit-switched connections, have been investigated. In this context, we consider the problem of aggregating files from distributed databases at a (grid) computing node over a lambda grid. The challenge is (1) to identify routes (that is, circuits) in the lambda-grid network, along which files should be transmitted, and (2) to schedule the transfers of these files over their respective circuits. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid approach that combines offline and online scheduling. We define the Time-Path Scheduling Problem (TPSP) for offline scheduling. We prove that TPSP is NP-complete, develop a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation for TPSP, and then propose a greedy approach to solve TPSP because the MILP does not scale well. We compare the performance of the greedy approach on a few representative lambda-grid network topologies. One key input to the offline schedule is the file transfer time. Due to dynamics at the receiving end host, which is hard to model precisely, the actual file transfer time may vary. We first propose a model for estimating the file transfer time. Then, we propose online reconfiguration algorithms so that as files are transferred, the offline schedule may be modified online, depending on the amount of time that it actually took to transfer the file. This helps in reducing the total time to transfer all the files, which is an important metric. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present results on an emulated lambda-grid network testbed."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.1112"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359400"",""lambda grid";circuit switching;routing;scheduling;large scale data transfers;lambda grid;circuit switching;routing;scheduling;"large scale data transfers"",""Scheduling algorithm";Routing;Circuits;Aggregates;Optical fiber networks;Distributed databases;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Processor scheduling;"Network topology"","""",""24"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""6 Dec 2007"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

HMMER 2.3.2 uses profile HMMs for sensitive database searching based on statistical descriptions of a sequence family's consensus (Durbin et al., 1998), Two of the nine programs were further parallelized to take advantage of the large number of processors, namely, hmmsearch and hmmpfam.

To achieve maximum energy saving, the memory management on data servers needs to judiciously utilize these energy-aware devices. As we explore different management schemes under five real-world parallel I/O workloads, we find that the memory energy behavior is determined by a complex interaction among four important factors: (1) cache hit rates that may directly translate performance gain into energy saving, (2) cache populating schemes that perform buffer allocation and affect access locality at the chip level, (3) request clustering that aims to temporally align memory transfers from different buses into the same memory chips, and (4) access patterns in workloads that affect the first three factors."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.109"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553704"",""Main memory";Storage Management;Operating Systems;Software/Software Engineering;Storage hierarchies;Parallel I/O;Interconnections (Subsystems);I/O and Data Communications Hardware;Main memory;Storage Management;Operating Systems;Software/Software Engineering;Storage hierarchies;Parallel I/O;Interconnections (Subsystems);"I/O and Data Communications Hardware"",""Clustering algorithms";Energy efficiency;Memory management;Energy consumption;Energy management;Supercomputers;Costs;Cooling;Performance gain;"Cache storage"","""",""4"","""",""48"",""IEEE"",""27 Jun 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

In this approach, each replica is assigned an expiration time beyond which the replica stops serving new requests unless it is validated. While TTL-based consistency is widely explored in many client-server applications, there has been no study on TTL-based consistency in P2P networks. Our main contribution is an analytical model that studies the search performance and the freshness of P2P content sharing under TTL-based consistency. Due to the random nature of request routing, P2P networks are fundamentally different from most existing TTL-based systems in that every node with a valid replica has the potential to serve any other node. We identify and discuss the factors that affect the performance of P2P content sharing under TTL-based consistency. Our results indicate a tradeoff between search performance and freshness: the search cost decreases sublinearly with decreasing freshness of P2P content sharing. We also compare two types of unstructured P2P networks and find that clustered P2P networks improve the freshness of content sharing over flat P2P networks under TTL-based consistency."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.44"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4468705"",""unstructured P2P network";TTL-based consistency;replication;consistency maintenance;content distribution;unstructured P2P network;TTL-based consistency;replication;consistency maintenance;"content distribution"",""Peer to peer computing";File systems;Domain Name System;Analytical models;Routing;Costs;IP networks;Surveillance;Large-scale systems;"Protocols"","""",""19"",""2"",""25"",""IEEE"",""7 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditionally the anonymity of an entity of interest can be achieved by hiding it among a group of other entities with similar characteristics, i.e., an anonymity set. In mobile ad hoc networks, generating and maintaining an anonymity set for any ad hoc node is challenging because of the node mobility, consequently the dynamic network topology. We propose protocols that use the destination position to generate a geographic area called an anonymity zone (AZ). A packet for a destination is delivered to all the nodes in the AZ, which make up the anonymity set. The size of the anonymity set may decrease because nodes are mobile, yet the corresponding anonymity set management is simple. We design techniques to further improve node anonymity and reduce communication overhead.

We conclude that in a circular multihop sensor network (modeled as concentric coronas) with nonuniform node distribution and constant data reporting, the unbalanced energy depletion among all the nodes in the network is unavoidable. Even if the nodes in the inner coronas of the network have used up their energy simultaneously, the ones in the outermost corona may still have unused energy. This is due to the intrinsic many-to-one traffic pattern of WSNs. Nevertheless, nearly balanced energy depletion in the network is possible if the number of nodes increases in geometric progression from the outer coronas to the inner ones except the outermost one. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel nonuniform node distribution strategy to achieve nearly balanced energy depletion in the network. We regulate the number of nodes in each corona and derive the ratio between the node densities in the adjacent (i + 1)th and ith coronas by the strategy.

In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling applications to ensure fair and efficient execution on a distributed network of processors. We limit our study to the case where communication is restricted to a tree embedded in the network, and the applications consist of a large number of independent tasks (Bags of Tasks) that originate at the tree's root. The tasks of a given application all have the same computation and communication requirements, but these requirements can vary for different applications. The goal of scheduling is to maximize the throughput of each application while ensuring a fair sharing of resources between applications. We can find the optimal asymptotic rates by solving a linear programming problem that expresses all necessary problem constraints, and we show how to construct a periodic schedule from any linear program solution. For single-level trees, the solution is characterized by processing tasks with larger communication-to-computation ratios at children with larger bandwidths. For multilevel trees, this approach requires global knowledge of all application and platform parameters. For large-scale platforms, such global coordination by a centralized scheduler may be unrealistic. Thus, we also investigate decentralized schedulers that use only local information at each participating resource. We assess their performance via simulation and compare to an optimal centralized solution obtained via linear programming. The best of our decentralized heuristics achieves the same performance on about 2/3 of our test cases but is far worse in a few cases. Although our results are based on simple assumptions and do not explore all parameters (such as the maximum number of tasks that can be held on a node), they provide insight into the important question of fairly and optimally scheduling heterogeneous applications on heterogeneous grids."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70747"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359436"",""Distributed architectures";Scheduling and task partitioning;Linear programming;Distributed architectures;Scheduling and task partitioning;"Linear programming"",""Processor scheduling";Throughput;Application software;Linear programming;Bandwidth;Resource management;Central Processing Unit;Computer networks;Large-scale systems;"Testing"","""",""38"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""31 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;

This paper proposes a strategy that reduces the number of off-chip references due to shared data. It achieves this goal by restructuring a parallelized application code in such a fashion that a given data block is accessed by parallel processors within the same time frame, so that its reuse is maximized while it is in the on-chip memory space. This tends to minimize the number of off-chip references since the accesses to a given data block are clustered within a short period of time during execution. Our approach employs a polyhedral tool that helps us isolate computations that manipulate a given data block. In order to test the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented it using a publicly-available compiler infrastructure and conducted experiments with twelve data-intensive embedded applications. Our results show that optimizing data locality for shared data elements is very useful in practice."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70760"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359444"",""Memory management";Compilers;Optimization;Multiprocessor Systems;Memory management;Compilers;Optimization;"Multiprocessor Systems"",""Memory management";Clocks;Parallel processing;Hardware;Energy consumption;Computer architecture;Switches;Testing;Optimizing compilers;"Embedded system"","""",""3"","""",""45"",""IEEE"",""29 Jul 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This scheme drastically reduces the computation load of each group member compared to existing schemes employing traditional encryption algorithms. Such a scheme is desirable for many wireless applications where portable devices or sensors need to reduce their computation as much as possible due to battery power limitations.

The unstructured network topology, however, contains many cyclic paths, which introduce numerous duplicate messages in the system. Although such messages can be identified and ignored, they still consume a large proportion of the bandwidth and other resources, causing bottlenecks in the entire network. In this paper, we describe the distributed cycle minimization protocol (DCMP), a dynamic fully decentralized protocol that significantly reduces the duplicate messages by eliminating unnecessary cycles. As queries are transmitted through the peers, DCMP identifies the problematic paths and attempts to break the cycles while maintaining the connectivity of the network. In order to preserve the fault resilience and load balancing properties of unstructured P2P systems, DCMP avoids creating a hierarchical organization. Instead, it applies cycle elimination symmetrically around some powerful peers to keep the average path length small. The overall structure is constructed fast with very low overhead. With the information collected during this process, distributed maintenance is performed efficiently even if peers quit the system without notification. The experimental results from our simulator and the prototype implementation on PlanetLab confirm that DCMP significantly improves the scalability of unstructured P2P systems without sacrificing their desirable properties. Moreover, due to its simplicity, DCMP can be easily implemented in various existing P2P systems and is orthogonal to the search algorithms."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70732"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359425"",""Network protocols";distributed systems;peer-topeer;Network protocols;distributed systems;"peer-topeer"",""Protocols";Peer to peer computing;Network topology;Broadcasting;Bandwidth;Resilience;Load management;Virtual prototyping;Scalability;"Control systems"","""",""12"","""",""24"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because multiple protocols are involved in a VoIP service and most of them are susceptible to flooding, an effective solution must be able to detect and overcome hybrid floods. As a solution, we offer the VoIP flooding detection system (vFDS)-an online statistical anomaly detection framework that generates alerts based on abnormal variations in a selected hybrid collection of traffic flows. It does so by viewing collections of related packet streams as evolving probability distributions and measuring abnormal variations in their relationships based on the Hellinger distance-a measure of variability between two probability distributions.

Beacons, the fewer the better, can acquire their position knowledge either from GPS devices or by virtue of being manually placed. In this paper, we propose a distributed method to localization of sensor nodes using a single moving beacon, where sensor nodes compute their position estimate based on the range-free technique. Two parameters are critical to the location accuracy of sensor nodes: the radio transmission range of the beacon and how often the beacon broadcasts its position. Theoretical analysis shows that these two parameters determine the upper bound of the estimation error when the traverse route of the beacon is a straight line. We extend the position estimate when the traverse route of the beacon is randomly chosen in a real-world situation, where the radio irregularity might cause a node to miss some crucial coordinate information from the beacon. We further point out that the movement pattern of the beacon plays a pivotal role in the localization task for sensors. To minimize estimation errors, sensor nodes can carry out a variety of algorithms in accordance with the movement of the beacon.

Our scheme takes the heterogeneity nature into account and forms the replica nodes of a key into a locality-aware hierarchical structure, in which the upper layer is DHT-based and consists of powerful and stable replica nodes, while a replica node at the lower layer attaches to a physically close upper layer node. A d-ary update message propagation tree (UMPT) is dynamically built upon the upper layer for propagating the updated contents.

Using a low-complexity linear heat recirculation model, we define the problem of minimizing the peak inlet temperature within a data center through task assignment (MPIT-TA), consequently leading to minimal cooling-requirement.

Hence, it is necessary to design new techniques to deal with these faults to be able to build sufficiently reliable Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). In this work, we present a coherence protocol aimed at dealing with transient failures that affect the interconnection network of a CMP, thus assuming that the network is no longer reliable.

Based on the observation that fault-free operation is expected to remain dominant in the near future and the probability of the worst case faults is low, an optimistic fault-tolerant heuristic is then proposed to achieve maximum energy savings in the absence of faults while degrading gradually to meet application timing requirements in the worst case of faults. Simulation results show that compared to state-of-art allocation and scheduling schemes proposed heuristic achieves average energy savings of up to 70%. It is also shown that optimistic approach is more resilient to variations in application utilizations and fault occurrences beyond system specifications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.127"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564448"",""Energy-aware systems";Real-time and embedded systems;Multiprocessor Systems;Scheduling and task partitioning;Energy-aware systems;Real-time and embedded systems;Multiprocessor Systems;"Scheduling and task partitioning"",""Energy efficiency";Fault tolerant systems;Real time systems;Multiprocessing systems;Circuit faults;Processor scheduling;Embedded system;Parallel processing;Checkpointing;"Fault tolerance"","""",""21"","""",""42"",""IEEE"",""15 Jul 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

FlexiTP is scalable for a large number of nodes because its depth-first-search schedule minimizes buffering, and it allows communication slots to be reused by nodes outside each other's interference range. Hence, the overall scheme of FlexiTP provides end-to-end guarantees on data delivery (throughput, fair access, and robust self-healing) while also respecting the severe energy and memory constraints of wireless sensor networks. Simulations in ns-2 show that FlexiTP ensures energy efficiency and is robust to network dynamics (faults such as dropped packets and nodes joining or leaving the network) under various network configurations (network topology and network density), providing an efficient solution for data-gathering applications.

In this paper, we present a fluid model with two different classes of peers to capture the effect of free-riding on BitTorrent-like systems. With the model, we find that BitTorrent's incentive mechanism is successful in preventing free-riding in a system without seeds but may not succeed in producing a disincentive for free-riding in a system with a high number of seeds. The reason for this is that BitTorrent does not employ any effective mechanisms for seeds to effectively guard against free-riding.

One array, with lower accuracy and representing the distribution of the entire metadata, trades accuracy for significantly reduced memory overhead, whereas the other array, with higher accuracy, caches partial distribution information and exploits the temporal locality of file access patterns. Both arrays are replicated to all metadata servers to support fast local lookups. We evaluate HBA through extensive trace-driven simulations and implementation in Linux.

In this paper, we present hierarchical multiprocessor scheduling (H-SMP), a novel hierarchical CPU scheduling algorithm designed for a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) platform. The novelty of this algorithm lies in its combination of space and time multiplexing to achieve the desired bandwidth partition among the nodes of the hierarchical scheduling tree. This algorithm is also characterized by its ability to incorporate existing proportional-share algorithms as auxiliary schedulers to achieve efficient hierarchical CPU partitioning. In addition, we present a generalized weight feasibility constraint that specifies the limit on the achievable CPU bandwidth partitioning in a multiprocessor hierarchical framework and propose a hierarchical weight readjustment algorithm designed to transparently satisfy this feasibility constraint. We evaluate the properties of H-SMP using hierarchical surplus fair scheduling (H-SFS), an instantiation of H-SMP that employs surplus fair scheduling (SFS) as an auxiliary algorithm.

This paper proposes a suite of algorithms which jointly optimize the performance of dynamic content applications by reducing the client access times while also minimizing the resource utilization. A server migration algorithm allocates servers on-demand within a cluster such that the client access times are not affected even under sudden overload conditions. Further, a server selection mechanism enables statistical multiplexing of resources across clusters by redirecting requests away from overloaded clusters.

We have presented the methodology as a three-phase strategy, in which task nodes are mapped to the processors in the first (static mapping) phase. In the second (selective duplication) phase, some critical nodes are identified and duplicated for possible rescheduling at runtime, depending on the code memory constraints of the processors. The third (online) phase is a runtime scheduling algorithm that performs list scheduling based on the actual dynamics of the schedule up to the current time. We show that this technique provides better schedule length (up to 20 percent) compared to previous techniques, which are predominantly static in nature, with low overhead and a complexity comparable with existing online techniques.

This procedure repeats until a time-to-live (TTL) counter is decremented to 0. Flooding can seriously limit system scalability, because the number of redundant query messages grows exponentially during the message propagation. Our study shows that more than 70 percent of the generated messages are redundant in a flooding with a TTL of 7 in a moderately connected Gnutella network. Existing efforts to address this issue have been focused on limiting the use of the flooding operation. We propose a new flooding scheme, called LightFlood, with the objective of minimizing the number of redundant messages and retaining a similar message-propagating scope as that of the standard flooding. In the scheme, each peer keeps track of the connectivities of every immediate and next indirect neighbor peers, which can be acquired locally. LightFlood identifies the neighbor with the highest connectivity and uses the link to that neighbor to form a suboverlay within the existing P2P overlay. In LightFlood, flooding is divided into two stages. The first stage is a standard flooding with a limited number of TTL hops, where a message can spread to a sufficiently large scope with a small number of redundant messages. In the second stage, message propagating is only conducted along the suboverlay, significantly reducing the number of redundant messages. Our analysis and simulation experiments show that the LightFlood scheme provides a low-overhead broadcast facility that can be effectively used in P2P search. For example, compared with standard flooding with seven TTL hops, we show that LightFlood with an additional two to three hops can reduce up to 69 percent of the flooding messages and retain the same flooding scope. We believe that LightFlood can be widely used as a core mechanism for efficient message broadcasting in P2P systems due to its near-optimal performance."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70772"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359452"",""Peer-to-Peer System";File Searching;Overlay Network;Query Flooding.;Peer-to-Peer System;File Searching;Overlay Network;"Query Flooding."",""Peer to peer computing";Broadcasting;Floods;Scalability;Counting circuits;Optical propagation;Analytical models;Web and internet services;Network servers;"Web server"","""",""59"","""",""16"",""IEEE"",""31 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, motivated by classical dynamics that study the movement of objects, we propose the concept of network dynamics and define the associated potential functions that capture the operational goals, as well as the environment of an MSN. We find that in managing the mobility of an MSN, Newton's laws of motion in classical dynamics are insufficient, for they introduce oscillations into the movement of sensor nodes. Instead, in network dynamics, the laws of motion are formulated using the steepest descent method in optimization. Based on the network dynamics model, we first devise a parallel and distributed algorithm (parallel and distributed network dynamics (PDND)) that runs on each sensor node to guide its movement. PDND then turns sensor nodes into autonomous entities that are capable of adjusting their locations according to the operational goals and environmental changes. After that, we formally prove the convergence of PDND.

In this paper, we choose a popular notion of fairness called max-min fairness and provide a rigorous definition in the context of input-queued switches. We show that being fair at the output ports alone or at the input ports alone or even at both input and output ports does not actually achieve an overall max-min fair allocation of bandwidth in a switch. Instead, we propose a new algorithm that can be readily implemented in a distributed fashion at the input and output ports to determine the exact max-min fair rate allocations for the flows through the switch.

We present simulation results, using both real traffic traces and synthetic traffic, to evaluate the fairness of a variety of popular scheduling algorithms for input-queued switches.

Speculative multithreading increases single-threaded application performance by exploiting thread-level parallelism speculatively - that is, executing code in parallel even when the compiler or runtime system cannot guarantee the parallelism exists. The proposed approach is based on predicting/computing thread input values via software, through a piece of code that is added at the beginning of each thread (the pre-computation slice). A pre-computation slice is expected to compute the correct thread input values most of the time, but not necessarily always. This allows aggressive optimization techniques to be applied to the slice to make it very short. This paper focuses on the microarchitecture that supports this execution model. The primary novelty of the microarchitecture is the hardware support for the execution and validation of pre-computation slices. Additionally, this paper presents new architectures for the register file and the cache memory in order to support multiple versions of each variable and allow for efficient roll-back in case of misspeculation.

The cluster delegation feature of NFS-CD allows data sharing among clients by extending the NFSv4 delegation model so that multiple clients manage a single file without interacting with the server. Based on cluster delegation, we implement a fast-commit primitive, cooperative caching, and the ability to recover the uncommitted updates of a failed computer. NFS-CD supports both read and write operations in the cooperative cache without degrading the consistency model of NFSv4. We have implemented NFS-CD by modifying the Linux NFSv4 client only. Because the server remains unchanged, NFS-CD preserves the simple administration model of NFSv4 and interoperates with standard NFS clients. NFS-CD offers improved performance when compared to NFSv4 at the expense of slightly weaker reliability guarantees. An experimental evaluation of our implementation, using industry standard benchmarks and application workloads, reveals that NFS-CD reduces server load by more than half.

To this end, the past two years have witnessed significant progress in the single-processor setting, and online algorithms with performance close to optimal have been obtained. In this paper we extend the study of optimizing the tradeoff between flow time and energy to the multi-processor setting. We derive and analyze a simple non-migratory online algorithm that makes use of the classified-round-robin (CRR) strategy to dispatch jobs. Even in the worst case, its performance is within O(log P) times of the optimal migratory offline algorithm, where P is the ratio of the maximum job size to the minimum job size.

Harmonizing MAC parameters of traffic classes's flows may further lead to sub-optimal situations since certain network configurations (in terms of per class traffic load) can not be accommodated without reassigning the basic MAC parameters. In this paper, we propose a new cross-layer MAC design featuring a delay-sensitive backoff range adaptation along with a distributed flow admission control. By monitoring both MAC queue dynamics and network conditions, each traffic class reacts based on the degree to which application QoS metrics (delay) are satisfied. Besides, we use a distributed admission control mechanism to accept new flows while protecting the active one.

The analysis observes that the hardware laid out for worst-case requirements in the integer pipeline is highly underutilized for a significant portion of time. To alleviate the complexity issues, we propose the split pipeline architecture, a novel technique to distinguish and process instructions based on their source operand requirements. The conventional pipeline is split into two after the decode stage, and the two pipelines are again converged at the execution stage. This leads to a capability of processing instructions at a higher clock rate and at almost the same instruction-per-cycle (IPC) throughput, as compared to a conventional processor. Various flavors of the proposed architecture are simulated and analyzed in this paper, with a circuit level analysis to determine the impact on the critical path delays. Results show that a processor that can fetch, decode, and commit eight instructions in each cycle and with split pipelines of two two-source integer instruction and six zero/one-source integer instruction can achieve a clock rate that is 15.8 percent faster than an eight-wide conventional processor while reducing the IPC throughput by only 0.7 percent for SPEC2000 benchmarks. Similarly, a four-wide processor with split pipelines of one two-source integer instruction and three zero/one-source integer instructions can achieve a clock rate that is 19.69 percent faster than a four-wide conventional processor while reducing the IPC throughput by only 1.9 percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70742"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359960"","""",""Pipelines";Clocks;Throughput;Hardware;Decoding;Process design;Registers;Analytical models;Circuit simulation;"Circuit analysis"","""","""","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""3 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This mechanism optimizes the allocation of forwarding states in routers and can be used to improve the scalability of traditional IP multicast and source-specific multicast. Compared with previous work, our mechanism needs fewer routers in a multicast tree to store forwarding states and therefore leads to a more balanced distribution of forwarding states among routers. We focus on two problems and formulate each of them as an optimization problem. The first problem, referred to as minstate, minimizes the total number of routers that store forwarding states in a multicast tree. The second problem, referred to as balancestate, minimizes the maximum number of forwarding states stored in a router for all multicast groups, which is proved to be an NP-hard problem. We design a distributed algorithm that obtains the optimal solution to the first problem and propose an approximation algorithm for the second problem. We also prove that the approach adopted by most existing works to allocate forwarding states in the branching routers of a multicast tree is a special case of our mechanism. The simulation results show that the forwarding state allocation provided by previous work is concentrated on the backbone routers in the Internet, which may cause the scalability problem. In contrast, our mechanism can balance forwarding states stored among routers and reduce the number of routers that store the forwarding states for a multicast tree."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70754"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359438"",""Optimization";Multicast;Optimization;"Multicast"",""Multicast communication";Scalability;Multicast protocols;NP-hard problem;Algorithm design and analysis;Distributed algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Multicast algorithms;Spine;"Internet"","""",""4"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""3 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditionally, the grid workflow execution is approached as a pure best effort scheduling problem that maps the activities onto the grid processors based on appropriate optimization or local matchmaking heuristics such that the overall execution time is minimized. Even though such heuristics often deliver effective results, the execution in dynamic and unpredictable grid environments is prone to severe performance losses that must be understood for minimizing the completion time or for the efficient use of high-performance resources. In this paper, we propose a new systematic approach to help the scientists and middleware developers understand the most severe sources of performance losses that occur when executing scientific workflows in dynamic grid environments. We introduce an ideal model for the lowest execution time that can be achieved by a workflow and explain the difference to the real measured grid execution time based on a hierarchy of performance overheads for grid computing. We describe how to systematically measure and compute the overheads from individual activities to larger workflow regions and adjust well-known parallel processing metrics to the scope of grid computing, including speedup and efficiency. We present a distributed online tool for computing and analyzing the performance overheads in real time based on event correlation techniques and introduce several performance contracts as quality-of-service parameters to be enforced during the workflow execution beyond traditional best effort practices.

Compared to traditional approaches such as server-based mixing, peerTalk achieves better scalability and failure resilience by dynamically distributing the stream processing workload among different peers. Particularly, peerTalk decouples the MVolP service delivery into two phases: mixing phase and distribution phase. The decoupled model allows us to explore the asymmetric property of MVolP services (for example, distinct speaking/listening activities and unequal inbound/outbound bandwidths) so that the system can better adapt to distinct stream mixing and distribution requirements. To overcome arbitrary peer departures/ failures, peerTalk provides lightweight backup schemes to achieve fast failure recovery. We have implemented a prototype of the peerTalk system and evaluated its performance using both a large-scale simulation testbed and a real Internet environment.

Existing implementations of the best known classifiers such as maximum Aposterior (MAP) classifier are computationally infeasible for WSN environments. The focus of this paper is to investigate computational techniques to realize power efficient distributed implementation of the MAP classifier. In the MAP classifier, one of the most computationally challenging steps is the computation of the inverse of the covariance matrices. In this paper, we study computationally efficient methods for realizing the inverse of a matrix. We present a detailed discussion of one-sided Jacobi Iterations and LU Decomposition for approximating and computing the inverse of the covariance matrices.

It has been shown through analysis and simulation that it is impossible to guarantee uniform energy depletion of all the sensors in static uniformly distributed always-on WSNs with constant data reporting to the sink when the sensors use their nominal communication range to transmit data to the sink. We prove that the energy sink-hole problem can be solved provided that the sensors adjust their communication ranges. This solution, however, imposes a severe restriction on the size of a sensor field. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensor deployment strategy based on energy heterogeneity with a goal that all the sensors deplete their energy at the same time.

Other workloads benefit from Quiver, dispersing the computation load across the proxies and saving the costs of sending operation parameters over the wide area when these are large.

The main reason of this oscillation is that most queue management schemes determine the drop probability based on the current traffic without consideration on the impact of that drop probability on the future traffic. In this paper, we propose a new active queue (AQM) scheme to reduce queue oscillation and realize stable queue length. The proposed scheme measures the current arrival and drop rates, and uses them to estimate the next arrival rate. Based on this estimation, the scheme calculates the drop probability which is expected to realize stable queue length. We present extensive simulation with various topologies and offered traffic to evaluate performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme remarkably reduces queue length oscillation compared to other well-known AQMs. It is also shown that the proposed scheme improves fairness among TCP flows due to the stable drop probability, and maintains high utilization with small queue length."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70733"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359426"",""Packet-switching networks";Network management;Routers.;Packet-switching networks;Network management;"Routers."",""Traffic control";Delay;Jitter;Current measurement;Probability;Topology;Bandwidth;Manufacturing;Costs;"Internet"","""",""9"","""",""21"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, multimedia streaming sessions need to be resilient to volatile network dynamics and node departures that are characteristic in peer-to-peer networks. Second, they need to take full advantage of the existing bandwidth capacities, by minimizing the delivery of redundant content and the need for content reconciliation among peers during streaming. Finally, streaming peers need to be optimally selected to construct high-quality streaming topologies, so that end-to-end latencies are taken into consideration. The original contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose to use a recent coding technique, referred to as rateless codes, to code the multimedia bitstreams before they are transmitted over peer-to-peer links. The use of rateless codes eliminates the requirements of content reconciliation, as well as the risks of delivering redundant content over the network. Rateless codes also help the streaming sessions to adapt to volatile network dynamics. Second, we minimize end-to-end latencies in streaming sessions by optimizing towards a latency-related objective in a linear optimization problem, the solution to which can be efficiently derived in a decentralized and iterative fashion. The validity and effectiveness of our new contributions are demonstrated in extensive experiments in emulated realistic peer-to-peer environments with our rStream implementation."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.1119"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359407"",""Distributed networks";distributed applications;peer-to-peer protocol;media streaming;Distributed networks;distributed applications;peer-to-peer protocol;"media streaming"",""Peer to peer computing";Streaming media;Bandwidth;Delay;Bit rate;Resilience;Protocols;Network servers;Topology;"Stability"","""",""50"",""4"",""29"",""IEEE"",""6 Dec 2007"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on this observation, we then propose stochastic automata rate adaptation algorithm (SARA). SARA is inspired by stochastic learning automata (SLA), a machine learning technique for adaptation in random environments. SARA assigns a selection probability to each of the transmission rates. It then randomly selects a rate for a transmission attempt and dynamically updates the probabilities based on the obtained feedback from the receiver (ACK/NACK), thereby obviating the need for explicit channel estimation or predefined thresholds. As opposed to the previous work, SARA is ideally suited for both stationary and non-stationary channel environments and is fully compatible with the existing IEEE 802.11 MAC standard.

SSW achieves the efficiency based on four ideas: 1) semantic clustering, where peers with similar semantics organize into peer clusters, 2) dimension reduction, where to address the high maintenance overhead associated with capturing high-dimensional data semantics in the overlay, peer clusters are adaptively mapped to a one-dimensional naming space, 3) small world network, where peer clusters form into a one-dimensional small world network, which is search efficient with low maintenance overhead, and 4) efficient search algorithms, where peers perform efficient semantic-based search, including approximate point query and range query in the proposed overlay.

For these systems to be effective, load balancing among the peers is critical. Most structured P2P systems rely on ID-space partitioning schemes to solve the load imbalance problem and have been known to result in an imbalance factor of ominus(logN) in the zone sizes. This paper makes two contributions. First, we propose addressing the virtual-server-based load balancing problem systematically using an optimization-based approach and derive an effective algorithm to rearrange loads among the peers. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal in general and its advantages over previous strategies in particular. We also explore other important issues vital to the performance in the virtual server framework, such as the effect of the number of directories employed in the system and the performance ramification of user registration strategies. Second, and perhaps more significantly, we systematically characterize the effect of heterogeneity on load balancing algorithm performance and the conditions in which heterogeneity may be easy or hard to deal with based on an extensive study of a wide spectrum of load and capacity scenarios."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70735"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359428"",""distributed hash table";load balance;local search;structured peer-to-peer system;generalized assignment problem;distributed hash table;load balance;local search;structured peer-to-peer system;"generalized assignment problem"",""Load management";Peer to peer computing;Computer networks;Network servers;Handheld computers;Bandwidth;Web server;Next generation networking;IP networks;"Partitioning algorithms"","""",""23"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""4 Jan 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The network coding technique proposed recently is promising for establishing multicast connections with a significantly lower bandwidth requirement than that of traditional Steiner-tree-based multicast connections. How to design multicast network topologies with the consideration of efficiently supporting multicast by the network coding technique becomes an important issue now. It is notable, however, that the conventional algorithms for network topology design are mainly unicast-oriented, and they cannot be adopted directly for the efficient topology design of network-coding-based multicast networks by simply treating each multicast as multiple unicasts. In this paper, we consider for the first time the novel topology design problem of network-coding-based multicast networks. Based on the characteristics of multicast and network coding, we first formulate this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which is NP-hard, and then propose two heuristic algorithms for it. The effectiveness of our heuristics is verified through simulation and comparison with the exhaustive search method. We demonstrate in this paper that, in the topology design of multicast networks, adopting the network coding technique to support multicast transmissions can significantly reduce the overall topology cost as compared to conventional unicast-oriented design and the Steiner-tree-based design."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70743"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359432"",""Network coding";multicast networks;topology design;heuristic algorithms;Network coding;multicast networks;topology design;"heuristic algorithms"",""Network topology";Network coding;Multicast algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Communication networks;Bandwidth;Unicast;Heuristic algorithms;"Search methods"","""",""13"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""31 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

Users are often interested in querying an underlying continuous phenomenon such as a toxic plume, whereas only discrete readings of sensor nodes are available. Therefore, additional information estimation methods are necessary to process the sensor readings to generate the required query results. Most estimation methods are computationally intensive, even when computed in a traditional centralized setting. Furthermore, energy and communication constraints of sensor networks challenge the efficient application of established estimation methods in sensor networks. In this paper, we present an approach using Gaussian kernel estimation to process spatial window queries over continuous phenomena in sensor networks. The key contribution of our approach is the use of a small number of Hermite coefficients to approximate the Gaussian kernel function for subclustered sensor nodes. As a result, our algorithm reduces the size of messages transmitted in the network by logarithmic order, thus saving resources while still providing high-quality query results."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70741"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359431"",""Wireless sensor networks";spatial databases;distributed databases;query processing;Wireless sensor networks;spatial databases;distributed databases;"query processing"",""Sensor phenomena and characterization";Kernel;Distributed databases;Spatial databases;Query processing;Sensor systems;Costs;Computer networks;Computational efficiency;"Database systems"","""",""19"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""3 Mar 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we argue that the worm break-in provenance information has not been exploited in achieving these capabilities and thus propose process coloring, a new approach that preserves worm break-in provenance information and propagates it along operating- system-level information flows. More specifically, process coloring assigns a """"color,"""" a unique systemwide identifier, to each remotely accessible server process. The color will be either inherited by spawned child processes or diffused transitively through process actions. Process coloring achieves three new capabilities: color-based worm warning generation, break-in point identification, and log file partitioning. The virtualization-based implementation enables more tamper-resistant log collection, storage, and real-time monitoring. Beyond the overhead introduced by virtualization, process coloring only incurs very small additional system overhead.

"TROP: A Novel Approximate Link-State Dissemination Framework For Dynamic Survivable Routing in MPLS Networks,""J. Tapolcai"; P. -H. Ho;" A.

While performing dynamic explicit survivable routing in a distributed environment, link-state dissemination may cause a nontrivial signaling overhead in the process of exploring spare resource sharing among individual backup label switched paths (LSPs). Several previously reported studies have tackled this problem by initiating a compromise between the amount of dissemination and the achievable extent of resource sharing. The paper first summarizes the previously reported schemes into a compact and general link-state dissemination framework by way of singular value decomposition (SVD). To improve the accuracy of the matrix reconstruction and to eliminate the overestimation of the sharable spare capacity along each link, a novel SVD approach based on the min-plus algebra (also called tropical semirings) is introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can achieve a lower blocking probability than that by all the other counterpart schemes while taking the same complexity of link-state dissemination. This great advantage is gained at the expense of a longer computation time for solving a linear program (LP) in each dissemination cycle at the core nodes. We also consider the stale link-state phenomena that may cause imprecision in the routing information at the ingress nodes due to the delay in the periodic/event-driven link-state update message advertisement."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2007.70744"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359433"",""Shared protection";Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS);Singular value decomposition (SVD);Stale link-state;Min-Plus algebra;Shared protection;Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS);Singular value decomposition (SVD);Stale link-state;"Min-Plus algebra"",""Routing";Multiprotocol label switching;Resource management;Protection;Signal processing;Singular value decomposition;Matrix decomposition;Algebra;Computational modeling;"Delay"","""",""8"","""",""21"",""IEEE"",""31 Jan 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;
