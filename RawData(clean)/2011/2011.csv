Recently, there has been active research on cooperative communication that improves the communication reliability by having a collection of radio terminals transmit signals in a cooperative way. This paper proposes a medium access control (MAC) algorithm, called Cooperative Diversity MAC (CD-MAC), which exploits the cooperative communication capability of the physical (PHY) layer to improve robustness in wireless ad hoc networks. In CD-MAC, each terminal proactively selects a partner for cooperation and lets it transmit simultaneously so that this mitigates interference from nearby terminals, and thus, improves the network performance. For practicability, CD-MAC is designed based on the widely adopted IEEE 802.11 MAC. For accurate evaluation, this study presents and uses a realistic reception model by taking bit error rate (BER), derived from Intersil HFA3861B radio hardware, and the corresponding frame error rate (FER) into consideration.

This requires performing a network reconfiguration, which consists in updating the routing function. The main challenge involved in network reconfiguration is the reduction of performance degradation during the change assimilation process. As shown in the performance evaluation section, former reconfiguration techniques significantly reduce network service since the application traffic is temporally stopped in order to avoid deadlocks.

Since the MPI communication libraries do not need to perform VLAN operations, the proposed methodology has advantages in both simple host configuration and high portability. In addition, when it is used with on/off and multispeed link regulation, the power consumption of Ethernet switches can be reduced. Evaluation results using NAS parallel benchmarks showed that the performance of the topologies that include loops using the proposed methodology was comparable to that of an ideal one-switch (full crossbar) network, and the torus topology in particular had up to a 27 percent performance improvement compared with a tree topology with link aggregation."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.73"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445093"",""Ethernet";routing;deadlock avoidance;interconnection networks;"PC clusters."",""Routing";Ethernet networks;Network topology;System recovery;Switches;Clustering algorithms;Joining processes;Local area networks;Tree data structures;"Broadcast technology"","""",""5"","""",""31"",""IEEE"",""8 Apr 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, most existing solutions rely on open-loop search or optimization with the assumption that power can be estimated accurately, while others adopt oversimplified feedback control strategies to control power and temperature separately, without any theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a chip-level power control algorithm that is systematically designed based on optimal control theory. Our algorithm can precisely control the power of a CMP chip to the desired set point while maintaining the temperature of each core below a specified threshold. Furthermore, an online model estimator is designed to achieve analytical assurance of control accuracy and system stability, even in the face of significant workload variations or unpredictable chip or core variations.

However, there is empirically a trade-off between the energy efficiency of the nodes and routes in a topology. Besides, it may consume considerable energy to maintain the topology due to node mobility. In this paper, we propose an adaptive topology control protocol for mobile nodes. The protocol allows each node to decide whether to support energy-efficient routing or conserve its own energy. Moreover, it can drastically shrink the broadcasting power of beacon messages for mobile nodes. We prove that any reconstruction and change of broadcasting radius converge in four and five beacon intervals, respectively.

Randomized network coding may improve block diversity and availability in P2P networks, as coded blocks are equally innovative and useful to peers. However, the computational complexity of network coding mandates that, in reality, network coding needs to be performed within segments, each containing a subset of blocks. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate how network coding may improve content availability, block diversity, and download performance in the presence of churn, as the number of blocks in each segment for coding varies. Based on stochastic models and a differential equation approach, we explore the fundamental tradeoff between the resilience gain of network coding to peer dynamics and its inherent coding complexity.

Although, accelerator-based architectures deliver enormous computational power, little attention has been devoted to assess the RTM implementations effort. The aim of this paper is to identify the major limitations imposed by different accelerators during RTM implementations, and potential bottlenecks regarding architecture features. Moreover, we suggest a wish list, that from our experience, should be included as features in the next generation of accelerators, to cope with the requirements of applications like RTM.

These results show that accelerators are well positioned platforms for this kind of workload.

Cluster systems have been regarded as a de facto standard to achieve multitera-flop computing power. These cluster systems, as we know, have an inherent failure factor that can cause computation failure. The reliability issue in parallel computing systems, therefore, has been studied for a relatively long time in the literature, and we have seen many theoretical promises arise from the extensive research. However, despite the rigorous studies, practical and easily deployable fault-tolerant systems have not been successfully adopted commercially. Athanasia is a user-transparent checkpointing system for a fault-tolerant Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation that is primarily based on the sync-and-stop protocol. Athanasia supports three critical functionalities that are necessary for fault tolerance: a light-weight failure detection mechanism, dynamic process management that includes process migration, and a consistent checkpoint and recovery mechanism. The main features of Athanasia are that it does not require any modifications to the application code and that it preserves many of the high performance characteristics of high-speed networks. Experimental results show that Athanasia can be a good candidate for practically deployable fault-tolerant systems in very-large and high-performance clusters and that its protocol can be applied to a variety of parallel communication libraries easily."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.63"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710900"",""User transparency";fault tolerance;message passing interface;parallel systems;Myrinet;InfiniBand;"ch_p4."",""Protocols";Checkpointing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Lead;Communication channels;"Process control"","""",""3"","""",""42"",""IEEE"",""10 Feb 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We consider in this paper a distributed channel assignment algorithm for uncoordinated WLANs, where APs can self-configure their operating channels to minimize interference with adjacent APs. We first formulate the optimization problem on channel assignment which overcomes some of the weaknesses encountered by uncoordinated WLANs. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and propose an efficient, simple, and distributed algorithm termed CACAO (Client-Assisted Channel Assignment Optimization). In CACAO, the clients feed back traffic information to their APs. This leads to better network condition knowledge and better channel assignment decisions at the APs. We conduct extensive simulation study and comparisons using Network Simulator 2 (NS2).

Not only does it satisfy some real application requirements, it also acts as an important aid for RFID identification. Due to the extremely long processing time, slotted ALOHA-based or tree-based arbitration protocols are often impractical for many applications, because tags are usually attached to moving objects and they may have left the readers interrogation region before being counted. Recently, estimation schemes have been proposed to count the approximate number of tags. Most of them, however, suffer from two scalability problems: time inefficiency and multiple-reading. Without resolving these problems, large-scale RFID systems cannot easily apply the estimation scheme as well as the corresponding identification. In this paper, we present the Lottery Frame (LoF) estimation scheme, which can achieve high accuracy, low latency, and scalability.

The CRP enables the construction of proximity-aware P2P content delivery systems. We present new data dissemination algorithms using this proximity-aware overlay design. We simulated P2P networks up to 20,000 nodes to validate the claimed advantages. Specifically, we make four technical contributions: 1). The CRP scheme promotes proximity awareness, dynamic load balancing, and resilience to node failures and network anomalies. 2). The proximity-aware overlay network has a 28-50 percent speed gain in massive data dissemination, compared with the use of scope-flooding or epidemic tree schemes in unstructured P2P networks. 3). The CRP-enabled network requires only 1/3 of the control messages used in a large CAM-Chord network. 4) Even with 40 percent of node failures, the CRP network guarantees atomic broadcast of all data items.

This dependence on monitoring data severely impacts both ease of deployment and adaptivity to dynamically changing network conditions. In this paper, we present Robber, a collective, receiver-initiated, high-throughput multicast approach inspired by the BitTorrent protocol. Unlike BitTorrent, Robber is specifically designed to maximize the throughput between multiple cluster computers. Nodes in the same cluster work together as a collective that tries to steal data from peer clusters. Instead of using potentially outdated monitoring data, Robber automatically adapts to the currently achievable bandwidth ratios. Within a collective, nodes automatically tune the amount of data they steal remotely to their relative performance. Our experimental evaluation compares Robber to BitTorrent, to Balanced Multicasting, and to its predecessor MOB. Balanced Multicasting optimizes multicast trees based on external monitoring data, while MOB uses collective, receiver-initiated multicast with static load balancing. We show that both Robber and MOB outperform BitTorrent. They are competitive with Balanced Multicasting as long as the network bandwidth remains stable, and outperform it by wide margins when bandwidth changes dynamically.

In any round, every awake process either listens or transmits. The message of a process i is heard by all other awake processes, if i is the only process to transmit in a given round. If more than one process transmits simultaneously, there is a collision and no message is heard. We consider three characteristics that may or may not exist in the channel: collision detection (listening processes can distinguish collision from silence), the availability of a global clock showing the round number, and the knowledge of the number n of all processes. If none of the above three characteristics is available in the channel, we prove that consensus and mutual exclusion are infeasible";" if at least one of them is available, both tasks are feasible, and we study their time complexity. Collision detection is shown to cause an exponential gap in complexity: if it is available, both tasks can be performed in time logarithmic in n, which is optimal, and without collision detection both tasks require linear time. We then investigate both consensus and mutual exclusion in the absence of collision detection, but under alternative presence of the two other features.

However, under conditions of extremely high congestion the repair capability of network coding is seriously degraded. In this paper, we propose cooperative channelization, in which portions of the transmission media are allocated to links that are congested at the point where network coding cannot efficiently repair loss.

To address the challenges and meet our objectives of minimizing the total survey time and traveled distance of AUVs, we propose a cooperative rendezvous scheme called Synchronization-Based Survey (SBS) to facilitate cooperation among a large number of AUVs when surveying a large area. In SBS, AUVs form an intermittently connected network (ICN) in that they periodically meet each other for data aggregation, control signal dissemination, and AUV failure detection/recovery. Numerical analysis and simulations have been performed to compare the performance of three variants of SBS schemes, namely, Alternating Column Synchronization (ACS), Strict Line Synchronization (SLS), and X Synchronization (XS).

However, a major challenge here is to maximize the sensing coverage in an unknown, noisy, and dynamically changing environment with nodes having limited sensing range and energy, and moving under distributed control. To address these challenges, we propose a new distributed algorithm, Causataxis, which enables the MSN to relocate toward the interesting regions and adjust its shape and position as the sensing environment changes.

We compare Causataxis with a swarm-based algorithm, which uses the concept of virtual spring forces to relocate mobile nodes based on local neighborhood information.

First, various customers need to be assured by meeting their required service-level agreements such as response time and throughput. Second, server power consumption must be controlled in order to avoid failures caused by power capacity overload or system overheating due to increasing high server density. However, existing work controls power and application-level performance separately, and thus, cannot simultaneously provide explicit guarantees on both. In addition, as power and performance control strategies may come from different hardware/software vendors and coexist at different layers, it is more feasible to coordinate various strategies to achieve the desired control objectives than relying on a single centralized control strategy. This paper proposes Co-Con, a novel cluster-level control architecture that coordinates individual power and performance control loops for virtualized server clusters. To emulate the current practice in data centers, the power control loop changes hardware power states with no regard to the application-level performance. The performance control loop is then designed for each virtual machine to achieve the desired performance even when the system model varies significantly due to the impact of power control. Co-Con configures the two control loops rigorously, based on feedback control theory, for theoretically guaranteed control accuracy and system stability. Empirical results on a physical testbed demonstrate that Co-Con can simultaneously provide effective control on both application-level performance and underlying power consumption."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.91"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467056"",""Power control";power management;performance;virtualization;server clusters;data centers;"control theory."",""Power control";Energy management;Control systems;Centralized control;Energy consumption;Hardware;Power system management;Delay;Throughput;"Software performance"","""",""99"",""7"",""38"",""IEEE"",""20 May 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, we present a new implementation of cyclic reduction for the parallel solution of tridiagonal systems and employ this scheme as a line relaxation smoother in our GPU-based multigrid solver.

Extensive simulations are performed to validate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Its implementation commonly uses a two-phase I/O strategy that partitions a file into disjoint file domains, assigns each domain to a unique process, redistributes the I/O data based on their locations in the domains, and has each process perform I/O for the assigned domain. The partitioning quality determines the maximal performance achievable by the underlying file system, as the shared-file I/O has long been impeded by the cost of file system's data consistency control, particularly due to the conflicted locks. This paper proposes a few file domain partitioning methods designed to reduce lock conflicts under the extent-based file locking protocol. Experiments from four I/O benchmarks on the IBM GPFS and Lustre parallel file systems show that the partitioning method producing minimum lock conflicts wins the highest performance.

Faced with high resource demand variability and with misfit resource renting policies, the current industry practice is to overprovision for each game tens of self-owned data centers, making the market entry affordable only for big companies. Focusing on the reduction of entry and operational costs, we investigate a new dynamic resource provisioning method for MMOG operation using external data centers as low-cost resource providers. First, we identify in the various types of player interaction a source of short-term load variability, which complements the long-term load variability due to the size of the player population. Then, we introduce a combined MMOG processor, network, and memory load model that takes into account both the player interaction type and the population size. Our model is best used for estimating the MMOG resource demand dynamically, and thus, for dynamic resource provisioning based on the game world entity distribution. We evaluate several classes of online predictors for MMOG entity distribution and propose and tune a neural network-based predictor to deliver good accuracy consistently under real-time performance constraints. We assess using trace-based simulation the impact of the data center policies on the quality of resource provisioning. We find that the dynamic resource provisioning can be much more efficient than its static alternative even when the external data centers are busy, and that data centers with policies unsuitable for MMOGs are penalized by our dynamic resource provisioning method.

Most of the existing energy-efficient routing protocols always forward packets along the minimum energy path to the sink to merely minimize energy consumption, which causes an unbalanced distribution of residual energy among sensor nodes, and eventually results in a network partition. In this paper, with the help of the concept of potential in physics, we design an Energy-Balanced Routing Protocol (EBRP) by constructing a mixed virtual potential field in terms of depth, energy density, and residual energy. The goal of this basic approach is to force packets to move toward the sink through the dense energy area so as to protect the nodes with relatively low residual energy. To address the routing loop problem emerging in this basic algorithm, enhanced mechanisms are proposed to detect and eliminate loops. The basic algorithm and loop elimination mechanism are first validated through extensive simulation experiments. Finally, the integrated performance of the full potential-based energy-balanced routing algorithm is evaluated through numerous simulations in a random deployed network running event-driven applications, the impact of the parameters on the performance is examined and guidelines for parameter settings are summarized.

In this paper, we focus on adaptive scheduling of malleable jobs with periodic processor reallocations based on parallelism feedback of the jobs and allocation policy of the system. We present an efficient adaptive scheduler Acdeq that provides parallelism feedback using an adaptive controller A-Control and allocates processors based on the well-known Dynamic Equipartitioning algorithm (Deq). Compared to A-Greedy, an existing adaptive scheduler that experiences feedback instability thus incurs unnecessary scheduling overheads, we show that A-Control achieves much more stable feedback among other desirable control-theoretic properties. Furthermore, we analyze algorithmically the performances of Acdeq in terms of its response time and processor waste for an individual job as well as makespan and total response time for a set of jobs. To the best of our knowledge, Acdeq is the first multiprocessor scheduling algorithm that offers both control-theoretic and algorithmic guarantees.

This is possible thanks to a class of unordered requests that usually succeed in resolving the cache misses. The problem of the unordered requests is that they can cause protocol races, which prevent some misses from being resolved. To eliminate races and ensure the completion of the unresolved misses, Token Coherence uses a starvation prevention mechanism named persistent requests. This mechanism is extremely inefficient and, besides, it endangers the scalability of Token Coherence since it requires storage structures (at each node) whose size grows proportionally to the system size. While multiprocessors continue including an increasingly number of nodes, both the performance and scalability of cache coherence protocols will continue to be key aspects. In this work, we propose an alternative starvation prevention mechanism, named priority requests, that outperforms the persistent request one. This mechanism is able to reduce the application runtime more than 20 percent (on average) in a 64-processor system. Furthermore, thanks to the flexibility shown by priority requests, it is possible to drastically minimize its storage requirements, thereby improving the whole scalability of Token Coherence.

We propose a novel technique, called Fact, which can perform FAst Communication Traces collection for large-scale parallel applications on small-scale systems. Our idea is to reduce the original program to obtain a program slice through static analysis, and to execute the program slice to acquire the communication traces. Our idea is based on an observation that most computation and message contents in parallel applications are not relevant to their spatial and volume communication attributes, and therefore can be removed for the purpose of communication trace collection. We have implemented Fact and evaluated it with NPB programs and Sweep3D. The results show that Fact can reduce resource consumptions by two orders of magnitude in most cases."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.49"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703089"",""Communication pattern";communication trace;message-passing program;"parallel application."",""Algorithm design and analysis";Libraries;Runtime environment;Process control;Message passing;"Data structures"","""",""12"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""28 Jan 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique paradigm brings about many new security challenges, which have not been well understood. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. In particular, we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion, is also a significant step toward practicality, since services in Cloud Computing are not limited to archive or backup data only. While prior works on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the support of either public auditability or dynamic data operations, this paper achieves both. We first identify the difficulties and potential security problems of direct extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for the seamless integration of these two salient features in our protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, we improve the existing proof of storage models by manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree construction for block tag authentication. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multiuser setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously.

In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained parallel applications on multiprocessor computer systems and present two energy-conscious scheduling algorithms using dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). A number of recent commodity processors are capable of DVS, which enables processors to operate at different voltage supply levels at the expense of sacrificing clock frequencies. In the context of scheduling, this multiple voltage facility implies that there is a trade-off between the quality of schedules and energy consumption. To effectively balance these two performance goals, we have devised a novel objective function and a variant from that.

While distributed architecture enjoys a more robust and fault-tolerant wireless sensor network (WSN), such architecture also poses a number of security challenges especially when applied in mission-critical applications such as battlefield and e-healthcare. First, as sensor data are stored and maintained by individual sensors and unattended sensors are easily subject to strong attacks such as physical compromise, it is significantly harder to ensure data security. Second, in many mission-critical applications, fine-grained data access control is a must as illegal access to the sensitive data may cause disastrous results and/or be prohibited by the law. Last but not least, sensor nodes usually are resource-constrained, which limits the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. To address the above challenges, we propose, in this paper, a distributed data access control scheme that is able to enforce fine-grained access control over sensor data and is resilient against strong attacks such as sensor compromise and user colluding. The proposed scheme exploits a novel cryptographic primitive called attribute-based encryption (ABE), tailors, and adapts it for WSNs with respect to both performance and security requirements.

This general problem includes the existing ones as its special cases (k = 1 and h = 1 in and k = 1 and h ≥ 2 in). It is also important in practice because some sensors can monitor multiple or all targets within their surveillance ranges and multisensor fusion (i.e., watching a target by multiple sensors) gives better surveillance results.

A desirable routing and charging mechanism encourages truthful utility reports from the nodes. We provide both negative and positive results toward such mechanism design.

In particular, the fraction of optimal routing cost that can be recovered through node charges cannot be significantly higher than 1/2. To answer the question whether constant-ratio cost recovery is possible, we further apply a primal-dual schema to simultaneously build a routing solution and a cost-sharing scheme, and prove that the resulting mechanism is group strategyproof and guarantees 1/4-approximate cost recovery against an optimal routing scheme."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.184"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611498"",""Mechanism design";wireless networks;game theory;linear programming;approximation algorithms;"theory."",""Wireless networks";Receivers;Routing;Steiner trees;Games;Algorithm design and analysis;"Upper bound"","""",""5"","""",""18"",""IEEE"",""28 Oct 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unfortunately, an approach with hardware support is expensive and has limited scalability, whereas one with optimization fails to handle incremental rule updates effectively. This work deals with rapid packet classification, realized by hashing round-down prefixes (HaRP) in a way that the source and the destination IP prefixes specified in a rule are rounded down to “designated prefix lengths” (DPL) for indexing into hash sets. HaRP exhibits superb hash storage utilization, able to not only outperform those earlier software-oriented classification techniques but also well accommodate dynamic creation and deletion of rules. HaRP makes it possible to hold all its search data structures in the local cache of each core within a contemporary processor, dramatically elevating its classification performance. Empirical results measured on an AMD 4-way 2.8 GHz Opteron system (with 1 MB cache for each core) under six filter data sets (each with up to 30 K rules) obtained from a public source unveil that HaRP enjoys up to some 3.6× throughput level achievable by the best known decision tree-based counterpart, HyperCuts (HC)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.195"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5629331"",""Classification rules";decision trees;filter data sets;hashing functions;incremental rule updates;IP prefixes;packet classification;routers;set-associative hash tables;"tuple space search."",""Classification algorithms";IP networks;Random access memory;Classification tree analysis;Hardware;"Data structures"","""",""18"",""18"",""25"",""IEEE"",""11 Nov 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we carry out an extensive experiment involving thousands of operational taxies in Shanghai city. Studying the taxi trace data on the frequency and duration of transfer opportunities between taxies, we observe that the tail distribution of the intercontact time, that is, the time gap separating two contacts of the same pair of taxies, exhibits an exponential decay, over a large range of timescale. This observation is in sharp contrast to recent empirical data studies based on human mobility, in which the distribution of the intercontact time obeys a power law. By analyzing a simplified mobility model that captures the effect of hot areas in the city, we rigorously prove that common traffic influxes, where large volume of traffic converges, play a major role in generating the exponential tail of the intercontact time.

In particular, systems in which multiple proxies share a remote authentication database can experience reduced performance due to latency. In this paper, we investigate how the application of parallel execution and batching can be used to maximize throughput while carefully balancing demands for bandwidth and call failure rates. Through the use of a modified version of OpenSER, a high-performance SIP proxy, we demonstrate that the traditional recommendation of simply launching a large number of parallel processes not only incurs substantial overhead and increases dropped calls, but can actually decrease call throughput. An alternative technique that we implement, request batching, similarly fails to achieve high proxy throughput. Through a carefully selected mix of batching and parallelization, we reduce the bandwidth required to maximize authenticated signaling throughput by the proxy by more than 75 percent. This mix also keeps the call loss rates below 1 percent at peak performance. In addition, we demonstrate that the delay introduced by batching is acceptable for VoIP applications. As a result, our technique significantly reduce the cost and increase the throughput of authentication for large-scale networks supporting SIP applications."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.62"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710899"",""SIP";VoIP;digest authentication;"SIP proxy performance."",""Authentication";Throughput;Databases;Bandwidth;Servers;Delay;"Scalability"","""",""1"","""",""26"",""IEEE"",""10 Feb 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recently, the complicated interactions between different Internet traffic management modules have been elegantly modeled by distributed primal-dual utility maximization, which sheds new light for developing effective management protocols. For single-path routing with given routes, the dual is a strictly concave network optimization problem. Unfortunately, the general form of multipath utility optimization is not strictly concave, making its solution quite unstable. Decomposition-based techniques like TRaffic-management Using Multipath Protocol (TRUMP) alleviates the instability, but their convergence is not guaranteed, nor is their optimality. They are also inflexible in differentiating the control at different links. In this paper, we address the above issues through a novel logarithm-barrier-based approach. Our approach jointly considers user utility and routing/congestion control. It translates the multipath utility maximization into a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems, with infinite logarithm barriers being deployed at the constraint boundary. We demonstrate that setting up barriers is much simpler than choosing traditional cost functions and, more importantly, it makes optimal solution achievable. We further demonstrate a distributed implementation, together with the design of a practical Logarithm Barrier-based-Multipath Protocol (LBMP). We evaluate the performance of LBMP through both numerical analysis and packet-level simulations. The results show that LBMP achieves high throughput and fast convergence over diverse representative network topologies. Such performance is comparable to TRUMP, and is often better.

This paper describes the design and implementation of a novel approach, namely, CR/TR-Motion, which adopts checkpointing/recovery and trace/replay technologies to provide fast, transparent VM migration for both LAN and WAN environments. With execution trace logged on the source host, a synchronization algorithm is performed to orchestrate the running source and target VMs until they reach a consistent state.

Experimental results show that the approach can drastically reduce migration overheads compared with memory-to-memory approach in a LAN: up to 72.4 percent on application observed downtime, up to 31.5 percent on total migration time, and up to 95.9 percent on the data to synchronize the VM state. The application performance overhead due to migration is kept within 8.54 percent on average. The results also show that for a variety of workloads migrated across WANs, the migration downtime is less than 300 milliseconds."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.86"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5733342"",""Copy-on-write checkpointing";deterministic replay;live migration;trace;"virtual machine."",""Synchronization";Algorithm design and analysis;Wide area networks;Local area networks;Virtual machining;"Checkpointing"","""",""70"",""12"",""37"",""IEEE"",""17 Mar 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this manuscript, we focus on ocean uncertainty prediction using the Error Subspace Statistical Estimation (ESSE) approach. In ESSE, uncertainties are represented by an error subspace of variable size. To predict these uncertainties, we perturb an initial state based on the initial error subspace and integrate the corresponding ensemble of initial conditions forward in time, including stochastic forcing during each simulation. The dominant error covariance (generated via SVD of the ensemble) is used for data assimilation. The resulting ocean fields are used as inputs for predictions of underwater sound propagation. ESSE is a classic case of Many Task Computing: It uses dynamic heterogeneous workflows and ESSE ensembles are data intensive applications. We first study the execution characteristics of a distributed ESSE workflow on a medium size dedicated cluster, examine in more detail the I/O patterns exhibited and throughputs achieved by its components as well as the overall ensemble performance seen in practice.

However, GPUs are designed as special-purpose coprocessors and their programming interfaces are less familiar than those on the CPUs to MapReduce programmers.

From the perspective of maximizing metadata throughput, an ideal metadata distribution policy should automatically balance the namespace locality and even distribution without manual intervention. None of existing metadata distribution schemes is designed to make such a balance. We propose a novel metadata distribution policy, Dynamic Dir-Grain (DDG), which seeks to balance the requirements of keeping namespace locality and even distribution of the load by dynamic partitioning of the namespace into size-adjustable hierarchical units. Extensive simulation and measurement results show that DDG policies with a proper granularity significantly outperform traditional techniques such as the Random policy and the Subtree policy by 40 percent to 62 times. In addition, from the perspective of file system reliability, metadata consistency is an equally important issue. However, it is complicated by dynamic metadata distribution. Metadata consistency of cross-metadata server operations cannot be solved by traditional metadata journaling on each server. While traditional two-phase commit (2PC) algorithm can be used, it is too costly for distributed file systems. We proposed a consistent metadata processing protocol, S2PC-MP, which combines the two-phase commit algorithm with metadata processing to reduce overheads. Our measurement results show that S2PC-MP not only ensures fast recovery, but also greatly reduces fail-free execution overheads."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.154"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557861"",""Distributed file systems";"metadata management."",""Servers";File systems;Decision support systems;Protocols;Manuals;Heuristic algorithms;"Reliability"","""",""37"",""1"",""39"",""IEEE"",""26 Aug 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In other words, it would be difficult to apply them in a decentralized network environment, as often found in the real world. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and scalable immunization strategy based on a self-organized computing approach called autonomy-oriented computing (AOC) [1], [2].

Through experiments involving both synthetic and real-world networks, we demonstrate that this strategy can effectively and efficiently locate highly-connected nodes in decentralized complex network environments of various topologies, and it is also scalable in handling large-scale decentralized networks.

To address this problem, we propose a node reclamation and replacement (NRR) strategy, with which a mobile robot or human labor called mobile repairman (MR) periodically traverses the sensor network, reclaims nodes with low or no power supply, replaces them with fully charged ones, and brings the reclaimed nodes back to an energy station for recharging. To effectively and efficiently realize the strategy, we develop an adaptive rendezvous-based two-tier scheduling scheme (ARTS) to schedule the replacement/reclamation activities of the MR and the duty cycles of nodes. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the ARTS scheme."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.25"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685240"",""Sensor networks";node reclamation and replacement;energy replenishment;"duty-cycle scheduling."",""Robot sensing systems";Surveillance;Schedules;Scheduling algorithm;Subspace constraints;Quality of service;"Scheduling"","""",""60"","""",""36"",""IEEE"",""10 Jan 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This technique is also prone to deadlocks. Adaptive routing algorithms provide alternative paths that can be used to escape congested areas and prevent some deadlocks to occur. If not designed carefully, these new paths may as well introduce deadlocks. A successful solution to deadlock prevention is to constrain the routing function such that it does not introduce any deadlock. Many necessary and sufficient conditions for deadlock-free routing have been proposed. The definition and the proof of these conditions are complex and error-prone. These conditions are often counterintuitive and difficult to understand. Moreover, they are not static, as they all require the analysis of configurations, i.e., the network state. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We present the first static necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free routing in wormhole networks. Our condition is much simpler and requires less assumptions than all previous ones. It is formally proven correct using an automated proof assistant.

Existing protocols have validated such advantages assuming altruistic and obedient peers. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework that characterizes a coding-based P2P content distribution market where rational agents seek for individual payoff maximization. Unlike existing game theoretical models, we focus on a decentralized resale market—through virtual monetary exchanges, agents buy the coded blocks from others and resell their possessions to those in need. We model such transactions as decentralized strategic bargaining games, and derive the equilibrium prices between arbitrary pairs of agents when the market enters the steady state. We further characterize the relations between coding complexity and market properties including agents' entry price and expected payoff, thus providing guidelines for strategic operations in a real P2P market. Our analysis reveals that the major power of network coding lies in maintaining stability of the market with impatient agents, and incentivizing agents with lower price and higher payoff, at the cost of reasonable coding complexity. Since the traditional P2P content distribution approach is a special case of network coding, our model can be generalized to analyze the equilibrium strategies of rational agents in decentralized resale markets."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.72"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719615"",""Network coding";P2P;pricing;decentralized market;economics;"game theory."",""Encoding";Network coding;Economics;Peer to peer computing;Pricing;Nash equilibrium;"Marketing and sales"","""",""6"","""",""16"",""IEEE"",""24 Feb 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conventional stress testing approaches measure server capacity offline in terms of application-level performance metrics like response time and throughput. They are limited in measurement accuracy and timeliness. In a multitier website, resource bottleneck often shifts between tiers as client access pattern changes. This makes the problem of online capacity measurement even more challenge. This paper presents an online measurement approach based on low-level hardware performance metrics such as instructions execution rate and cache access behavior. Such metrics together define a system internal running state. The measurement approach uses machine learning techniques to infer application-level performance at each tier from a set of selected hardware performance counters. A coordinated predictor is induced over individual tier-wide models to make global system performance prediction and identify the bottleneck when the system becomes overloaded. Experiments were conducted on a two-tier Tomcat/MySQL-configured website using TPC-W benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach was able to achieve an overload prediction accuracy of higher than 90 percent for a priori known input traffic mix and over 85 percent accuracy even for traffic causing frequent bottleneck shifting.

While various management strategies have been developed to effectively reduce server power consumption by transitioning hardware components to lower power states, they cannot be directly applied to today's data centers that rely on virtualization technologies. Virtual machines running on the same physical server are correlated because the state transition of any hardware component will affect the application performance of all the virtual machines. As a result, reducing power solely based on the performance level of one virtual machine may cause another to violate its performance specification. This paper proposes PARTIC, a two-layer control architecture designed based on well-established control theory.

The secondary performance control loop then manipulates CPU frequency for power efficiency based on the uniform performance level achieved by the primary loop.

Providing predictability in data access is, thus, essential to accommodate the large set of newly emerging large-scale, data-intensive computing applications. In this regard, accurate estimation of network performance is crucial to meeting the performance goals of such applications. Passive estimation based on past measurements is attractive for its relatively small overhead compared to relying on explicit probing. In this paper, we take a passive approach for network performance estimation. Our approach is different from existing passive techniques that rely either on past direct measurements of pairs of nodes or on topological similarities. Instead, we exploit secondhand measurements collected by other nodes without any topological restrictions. In this paper, we present Overlay Passive Estimation of Network performance (OPEN), a scalable framework providing end-to-end network performance estimation based on secondhand measurements, and discuss how OPEN achieves cost-effective estimation in a large-scale infrastructure.

Due to the high network deployment cost, it is crucial to understand and predict the real-time detection capability of a sensor network. However, most existing real-time analyses are based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of detection. In practice, data fusion has been adopted in a number of sensor systems to deal with sensing uncertainty and enable efficient collaboration among resource-limited sensors. However, real-time performance analysis of sensor networks designed based on data fusion has received little attention. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the fundamental real-time detection performance of large-scale sensor networks under stochastic sensing models. In particular, we consider two basic data fusion schemes, i.e., value fusion and decision fusion. Our results show that data fusion is effective in achieving stringent performance requirements such as short detection delay and low false alarm rates. Moreover, value fusion and decision fusion are suitable for low and high signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, respectively. Our results help understand the impact of data fusion and provide important guidelines for the design of real-time wireless sensor networks for intrusion detection. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection. The results show that data fusion can reduce the network density by about 60 percent compared with the disc model while detecting any intruder within one detection period at a false alarm rate lower than five percent."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.38"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703078"",""Data fusion";real-time intrusion detection;performance limits;"wireless sensor networks."",""Delay";Real time systems;Sensors;Noise;Data models;Stochastic processes;"Analytical models"","""",""23"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""28 Jan 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper presents a design and implementation of a predictable HPC system using feedback control and admission control. By creating a virtualized application layer and opportunistically multiplexing concurrent applications through the application of formal control theory, we regulate a job's progress such that the job meets its deadline without requiring exclusive access to resources even in the presence of a wide class of unexpected events. Admission control regulates access to resources when oversubscribed. Our experimental results using five widely used applications show that the feedback and admission controller achieves highly predictable HPC system. The designed feedback controller regulates the HPC job's progress accurately, close to the prediction by theory, thereby, showing the successful application of classic control theory to HPC workloads.

A practical way of increasing the wide area throughput at the application layer is using multiple parallel streams. Although increased number of parallel streams may yield much better performance than using a single stream, overwhelming the network by opening too many streams may have an inverse effect. The congestion created by excess number of streams may cause a drop down in the throughput achieved. Hence, it is important to decide on the optimal number of streams without congesting the network. Predicting this """"optimum” number is not straightforward, since it depends on many parameters specific to each individual transfer. Generic models that try to predict this number either rely too much on historical information or fail to achieve accurate predictions. In this paper, we present a set of new models which aim to approximate the optimal number with least history information and lowest prediction overhead. An algorithm is introduced to select the best combination of historic information to do the prediction for evaluation purposes as well as optimizing prediction by reducing error rate.

However, accurate data extraction is difficult-it is often too costly to obtain all sensor readings, as well as not necessary in the sense that the readings themselves only represent samples of the true state of the world. Clustering and prediction techniques, which exploit spatial and temporal correlation among the sensor data provide opportunities for reducing the energy consumption of continuous sensor data collection. Integrating clustering and prediction techniques makes it essential to design a new data collection scheme, so as to achieve network energy efficiency and stability. We propose an energy-efficient framework for clustering-based data collection in wireless sensor networks by integrating adaptively enabling/disabling prediction scheme. Our framework is clustering based. A cluster head represents all sensor nodes in the cluster and collects data values from them. To realize prediction techniques efficiently in WSNs, we present adaptive scheme to control prediction used in our framework, analyze the performance tradeoff between reducing communication cost and limiting prediction cost, and design algorithms to exploit the benefit of adaptive scheme to enable/disable prediction operations. Our framework is general enough to incorporate many advanced features and we show how sleep/awake scheduling can be applied, which takes our framework approach to designing a practical algorithm for data aggregation: it avoids the need for rampant node-to-node propagation of aggregates, but rather it uses faster and more efficient cluster-to-cluster propagation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work adaptively enabling/disabling prediction scheme for clustering-based continuous data collection in sensor networks.

One of the most important features of a VoIP network is privacy (for VoIP clients). Unfortunately, most peer-to-peer VoIP networks neither provide personalization nor guarantee a quantifiable privacy level. In this paper, we propose novel flow analysis attacks that demonstrate the vulnerabilities of peer-to-peer VoIP networks to privacy attacks. We then address two important challenges in designing privacy-aware VoIP networks: Can we provide personalized privacy guarantees for VoIP clients that allow them to select privacy requirements on a per-call basis? How to design VoIP protocols to support customizable privacy guarantee? This paper proposes practical solutions to address these challenges using a quantifiable k-anonymity metric and a privacy-aware VoIP route setup and route maintenance protocols.

To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient.

Since the majority of failures in P2P networks are transient (i.e., peers return with data intact), an intelligent system can reduce significant replication costs by not replicating data following transient failures. Reliably distinguishing permanent and transient failures, however, is a challenging task, because peers are unresponsive to probes in both cases. In this paper, we propose Protector, an algorithm that enables efficient replication policies by estimating the number of “remaining replicas” for each object, including those temporarily unavailable due to transient failures. Protector dramatically improves detection accuracy by exploiting two opportunities. First, it leverages failure patterns to predict the likelihood that a peer (and the data it hosts) has permanently failed given its current downtime. Second, it detects replication level across groups of replicas (or fragments), thereby balancing false positives for some peers against false negatives for others. Extensive simulations based on both synthetic and real traces show that Protector closely approximates the performance of a perfect “oracle” failure detector, and significantly outperforms time-out-based detectors using a wide range of parameters. Finally, we design, implement and deploy an efficient P2P storage system called AmazingStore by combining Protector with structured P2P overlays.

Though complementary to each other, they operate in session-wide static and distinctive modes. Moreover, users do not have control over the quality and cost levels of the streaming services. The performance degradation or cost increment can reach an unacceptable level under fast or highly unstable moving patterns. In this paper, we propose the QoS-based dynamic adaptation techniques for the flexible employment and smooth integration of headlight prefetching and dynamic chaining to continuously provide quality streaming services to mobile users. The QoS-aware dynamic headlight prefetching is for the cooperation between streaming access points to dynamically adjust the prefetching scheme in response to the fast changing moving patterns. Adaptive P2P media streaming is for the cooperation between mobile users such that multiple peers can be used as streaming sources to increase the likelihood of successful chaining. Furthermore, a QoS-based technique is developed to dynamically trigger and proportionally adjust the prefetching degree when the stability and quality of P2P streaming service vary.

In this paper, we study the problem of constructing scalable switches that have comparable performance (in the sense of 100 percent throughput and first-in first-out (FIFO) delivery of packets from the same flow) to output-buffered switches. For this, we propose a new concept, called quasi-output-buffered switch. Like an output-buffered switch, a quasi-output-buffered switch is a deterministic switch that achieves 100 percent throughput and delivers packets from the same flow in the FIFO order. Using the three stage Clos network, we show that one can recursively construct a larger quasi-output-buffered switch with a set of smaller quasi output-buffered switches. By recursively expanding the three-stage Clos network, we obtain a quasi-output-buffered switch with only 2 × 2 switches. Such a switch is called a packet-pair switch in this paper as it always transmits packets in pairs.

To address the two cases, we propose two novel scheduling strategies, referred to as Static Scheduling Strategy (SSS) and Dynamic Scheduling Strategy (DSS), respectively. In addition, we capture a task's processing requirements in our strategies, a unique feature that is applicable for handling loads on networks that run proprietary applications only on certain nodes. Thus, each task can only be processed by some certain nodes in our formulation.

Due to the spatial locality of the monitored signal and the oftentimes dense deployment of sensors, the samples taken by a set of nearby sensors can be regarded as equivalent. The problem is how to assign the sampling workload to this set of sensors and maintain a long-running operation.

Our contributions in this work are twofold. We first investigate the application of state-of-the-art sparse matrix partitioning models in order to attain high efficiency in parallel PageRank computations with a particular focus on reducing the preprocessing overhead they introduce.

In this paper, we attempt to trade-off between efficiency and security by giving a little dose of trust to BGP routers. We present a new flexible threat model that assumes for any path of length h, at least one BGP router is trustworthy, where h is a parameter that can be tuned according to security requirements. Based on this threat model, we present two new symmetric key approaches to securing BGP: the centralized key distribution approach and the distributed key distribution approach.

The sharing may cause cache thrashing and contention among co-running jobs. Job co-scheduling is an approach to tackling the problem by assigning jobs to cores appropriately so that the contention and consequent performance degradations are minimized. Job co-scheduling includes two tasks: the estimation of co-run performance, and the determination of suitable co-schedules. Most existing studies in job co-scheduling have concentrated on the first task but relies on simple techniques (e.g., trying different schedules) for the second. This paper presents a systematic exploration to the second task. The paper uncovers the computational complexity of the determination of optimal job co-schedules, proving its NP-completeness.

We find small-world patterns in the interest-sharing graphs of all four communities.

The scheduling subproblem deals with finding the optimal schedulable sets, which are defined as subsets of links that can be scheduled or activated simultaneously. We demonstrate that any solution of the scheduling subproblem can be built with \vert E\vert + 1 or fewer schedulable sets, where \vert E\vert is the number of links of the network.

Supporting large data entails a significant commitment of the high-throughput center storage system, scratch space. However, the scratch space is typically managed using simple “purge policies,” without sophisticated end-user data services to balance resource consumption and user serviceability. End-user data services such as offloading are performed using point-to-point transfers that are unable to reconcile center's purge and users' delivery deadlines, unable to adapt to changing dynamics in the end-to-end data path and are not fault-tolerant. Such inefficiencies can be prohibitive to sustaining high performance. In this paper, we address the above issues by designing a framework for the timely, decentralized offload of application result data. Our framework uses an overlay of user-specified intermediate and landmark sites to orchestrate a decentralized fault-tolerant delivery.

Most current congestion control algorithms try to alleviate the congestion by reducing the rate at which the source nodes inject packets into the network. However, this traffic control scheme always decreases the throughput so as to violate fidelity level required by the applications. In this paper, we present a solution that sufficiently exerts the idle or underloaded nodes to alleviate congestion and improve the overall throughput in WSNs. To achieve this goal, a traffic-aware dynamic routing (TADR) algorithm is proposed to route packets around the congestion areas and scatter the excessive packets along multiple paths consisting of idle and underloaded nodes. Utilizing the concept of potential in classical physics, our TADR algorithm is designed through constructing a hybrid virtual potential field using depth and normalized queue length to force the packets to steer clear of obstacles created by congestion and eventually move toward the sink. The simulation results show that the proposed solution improves the overall throughput by around 370 percent as compared to MintRoute, which is one of benchmark routing protocols. Furthermore, TADR scheme has low overhead suitable for large-scale, dense sensor networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.24"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685239"",""Wireless sensor networks";traffic-aware;routing;potential field;"gradient."",""Wireless sensor networks";Routing;Heuristic algorithms;Throughput;Algorithm design and analysis;Protocols;"Wireless communication"","""",""95"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""10 Jan 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While in many such networks the nodes are randomly deployed in massive quantity, there is a broad range of applications advocating manual deployment. A typical example is structure health monitoring, where the sensors have to be placed at critical locations to fulfill civil engineering requirements. The raw data collected by the sensors can then be forwarded to a remote base station (the sink) through a series of relay nodes. In the wireless communication context, the operation time of a battery-limited relay node depends on its traffic volume and communication range. Hence, although not bounded by the civil-engineering-like requirements, the locations of the relay nodes have to be carefully planned to achieve the maximum network lifetime. The deployment has to not only ensure connectivity between the data sources and the sink, but also accommodate the heterogeneous traffic flows from different sources and the dominating many-to-one traffic pattern. Inspired by the uniqueness of such application scenarios, in this paper, we present an in-depth study on the traffic-aware relay node deployment problem. We develop optimal solutions for the simple case of one source node, both with single and multiple traffic flows. We show however that the general form of the deployment problem is difficult, and the existing only connectivity-guaranteed solutions cannot be directly applied here. We then transform our problem into a generalized version of the Euclidean Steiner Minimum Tree problem (ESMT). Nevertheless, we face further challenges as its solution is in continuous space and may yield fractional numbers of relay nodes, where simple rounding of the solution can lead to poor performance. We thus develop algorithms for discrete relay node assignment, together with local adjustments that yield high-quality practical solutions. Our solution has been evaluated through both numerical analysis and ns-2 simulations and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that for all test cases where the continuous space optimal solution can be computed within acceptable time frames, the network lifetime achieved by our solution is very close to the upper bound of the optimal solution (the difference is less than 13.5 percent). Moreover, it achieves up to 6-14 times improvement over the existing traffic-oblivious strategies."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2011.20"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680899"",""Wireless sensor networks";data collection;deployment;traffic-aware;"relay node."",""Relays";Topology;Energy consumption;Algorithm design and analysis;Base stations;Numerical models;"Steiner trees"","""",""44"",""1"",""27"",""IEEE"",""6 Jan 2011"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In our design, such trajectory information is combined with the vehicular traffic statistics for a better performance.

Static resource partitioning techniques have been suggested, but are not as effective as dynamic ones since program behavior does change over the course of its execution. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Resource Partitioning Algorithm (ARPA) that dynamically assigns resources to threads according to changes in thread behavior. ARPA analyzes the resource usage efficiency of each thread in a given time period and assigns more resources to threads which can use them more efficiently. Its purpose is to improve the efficiency of resource utilization, thereby improving overall instruction throughput. Our simulation results on a set of 42 multiprogramming workloads show that ARPA outperforms the traditional fetch policy ICOUNT by 55.8 percent with regard to overall instruction throughput and achieves a 33.8 percent improvement over Static Partitioning. It also outperforms the current best dynamic resource allocation technique, Hill-climbing, by 5.7 percent. Considering fairness accorded to each thread, ARPA attains 43.6, 18.5, and 9.2 percent improvements over ICOUNT, Static Partitioning, and Hill-climbing, respectively, using a common fairness metric.

Aravind"",""Department of Computer Science, University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada"",""IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems"",""25 Apr 2011"",""2011"",""22"",""6"",""1056"",""1063"",""As multicore processors are becoming increasingly common everywhere, the future computing systems and devices are becoming inevitably concurrent. Also, on the applications side, automation is steadily infiltrating into everyday life, and hence, most software systems are becoming increasingly complex and concurrent. As a result, recent developments and projections indicate that we are entering into the era of concurrent programming. Synchronizing asynchronous concurrent processes in accessing a shared resource is an important issue. Among the synchronization issues, mutual exclusion is fundamental. Solutions to most higher level synchronization problems rely on the assurance of mutual exclusion. Several algorithms with varying characteristics are proposed in the literature to solve the mutual exclusion problem. This paper presents two new algorithms to solve the mutual exclusion problem. The algorithms are simple and have many nice properties."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.172"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601709"",""Mutual exclusion";process/thread synchronization;concurrent programming;nonatomicity;LRU fairness;fault tolerant;bounded timestamps;"shared memory."",""Algorithm design and analysis";Programming;Safety;Program processors;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;"Memory management"","""",""6"","""",""33"",""IEEE"",""14 Oct 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
