This resource management problem is important because an efficient solution to uplink access control is critical for supporting a large user population with a reasonable level of quality of service (QoS). While there are a number of recently proposed protocols for uplink access control, these protocols possess a common drawback in that they do not adapt well to the burst error properties, which are inevitable in using wireless communication channels. We propose a novel TDMA-based uplink access protocol, which employs a channel state dependent allocation strategy. Our protocol is motivated by two observations: (1) when channel state is bad, the throughput is low due to the large amount of FEC (forward error correction) or excessive ARQ (automatic repeated request) that is needed and (2) because of item 1, much of the mobile device's energy is wasted. The proposed protocol works closely with the underlying physical layer in that, through observing the channel state information (CSI) of each mobile device, the MAC protocol first segregates a set of users with good CSI from requests gathered in the request contention phase of an uplink frame. The protocol then judiciously allocates channel bandwidth to contending users based on their channel conditions. Simulation results indicate that the proposed protocol considerably outperforms five state-of-the-art protocols in terms of packet loss, delay, and throughput."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2002.1058098"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058098"","""",""Access control";Access protocols;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Wireless application protocol;Throughput;Forward error correction;Computer networks;Cellular networks;"Resource management"","""",""18"","""",""23"",""IEEE"",""10 Dec 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose a suitable addressing scheme for nodes (with two variants), derive a formula for distance between nodes, and present a very simple and elegant routing algorithm. This addressing scheme and corresponding routing algorithm for hexagonal interconnection are considerably simpler than previously proposed solutions. We then apply the addressing scheme for solving two problems in cellular networks. With the new scheme, the distance between the new and old cell to which a mobile phone user is connected can be easily determined and coded with three integers, one of them being zero. Further, in order to minimize the wireless cost of tracking mobile users, we propose hexagonal cell identification codes containing three, four, or six bits, respectively, to implement a distance based tracking strategy.

However, the principal drawback of these machines is a lack of programmability, caused by the absence of the global cache coherence that is necessary to provide a convenient shared view of memory in hardware. This forces the programmer to keep careful track of where each piece of data is stored, a complication that is unnecessary when a pure shared-memory view is presented to the user.

Possible applications for DVE systems are multiplayer video games, military and industrial trainings, and collaborative engineering. In general, a DVE system is composed of many servers and each server is responsible to manage multiple clients who want to participate in the virtual world. Each server receives updates from different clients (such as the current position and orientation of each client) and then delivers this information to other clients in the virtual world. The server also needs to perform other tasks, such as object collision detection and synchronization control. A large scale DVE system needs to support many clients and this imposes a heavy requirement on networking resources and computational resources. Therefore, how to meet the growing requirement of bandwidth and computational resources is one of the major challenges in designing a scalable and cost-effective DVE system. In this paper, we propose an efficient partitioning algorithm that addresses the scalability issue of designing a large scale DVE system. The main idea is to dynamically divide the virtual world into different partitions and then efficiently assign these partitions to different servers. This way, each server will process approximately the same amount of workload. Another objective of the partitioning algorithm is to reduce the server-to-server communication overhead. The theoretical foundation of our dynamic partitioning algorithm is based on the linear optimization principle. We also illustrate how one can parallelize the proposed partitioning algorithm so that it can efficiently partition a very large scale DVE system. Lastly, experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning algorithm under various settings of the virtual world."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.993202"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993202"","""",""Partitioning algorithms";Network servers;Large-scale systems;Virtual environment;Wide area networks;Games;Industrial training;Collaboration;Object detection;"Computer networks"","""",""131"",""18"",""36"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

The problem of identifying the optimal parallel configurations (a configuration is defined as a given hardware implementation of different operators along with their multiplicities) at different steps in a program is a very complex issue but, if solved, allows the power of these ALUs to be maximally used. This paper focuses on developing an automatic compilation framework for configuration analysis to exploit operator parallelism within loop nests. The focus of this work is on performing configuration analysis to minimize costly reconfiguration overheads. In our framework, we initially carry out some operator and loop transformations to expose more opportunities for configuration reuse. We then present a two pass solution. The first pass attempts to generate either maximal cutsets (a cutset is defined as a group of statements that execute under a given configuration) or maximally parallel configurations by performing an analysis on the program dependency graph (PDG) of a loop nest. The second pass analyzes the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of reconfigurations across different cutsets and attempts to eliminate the reconfiguration overheads by merging cutsets. This methodology is implemented in the SUIF compilation system and is tested using some loops extracted from Perfect benchmarks and Livermore kernels. Good speedups are obtained, showing the merit of the proposed method.

Apart from server capacity, another important issue in the deployment of CM servers is reliability. This study investigates rebuild algorithms for automatically rebuilding data stored in a failed disk into a spare disk. Specifically, a block-based rebuild algorithm is studied with the rebuild time and buffer requirement modeled. A buffer-sharing scheme is then proposed to eliminate the additional buffers needed by the rebuild process. To further improve rebuild performance, a track-based rebuild algorithm that rebuilds lost data in tracks is proposed and analyzed. Results show that track-based rebuild, while it substantially outperforms block-based rebuild, requires significantly more buffers (17-135 percent more) even with buffer sharing. To tackle this problem, a novel pipelined rebuild algorithm is proposed to take advantage of the sequential property of track retrievals to pipeline the reading and writing processes. This pipelined rebuild algorithm achieves the same rebuild performance as track-based rebuild, but reduces the extra buffer requirement to insignificant levels (0.7-1.9 percent). Numerical results computed using models of five commercial disk drives demonstrate that automatic rebuild of a failed disk can be done in a reasonable amount of time, even at relatively high server utilization (e.g., less than 1.5 hours at 90 percent utilization)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2002.1003860"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003860"","""",""Streaming media";Performance analysis;Information retrieval;Degradation;Lifting equipment;Algorithm design and analysis;Pipelines;Writing;Disk drives;"Fault tolerance"","""",""35"",""2"",""21"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

The proposed restricted area, defined to be a part of the network where message transmission concentrates, can be located following the region of adaptivity. By properly guiding message routing inside and outside the area, we are able to achieve more balanced buffer utilization and to reduce traffic congestion accordingly.

We first motivate the problem by showing the large performance gap that can be introduced by a mismatch of model and synchronization method. Our solution calls for each channel between submodels to be classified as synchronous or asynchronous. We mathematically formulate the problem of optimally classifying channels and show that, in principle, the optimal classification can be obtained in time proportional to max{C/spl times/log C, V/spl times/N}, where C is the number of channels, V the number of unique minimal delays on those channels, and N is the number of submodels. We then demonstrate an implementation which finds an optimal solution at runtime and consider its performance on network topologies, including one of the global Internet at the autonomous system level.

The LEACH protocol presented by Heinzelman et al. (2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy /spl times/ delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy /spl times/ delay using CDMA and non-CDMA sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, LEACH, and our schemes with respect to energy /spl times/ delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes.

Efficient algorithms have been proposed in the literature to detect special classes of predicates, such as conjunctive predicates and bounded sum predicates.

Data-parallel languages such as High-Performance Fortran (HPF) thus offer means allowing a programmer both to specify data distributions and to change them dynamically in order to maintain these properties. On the other hand, redistributions can be quite expensive and can significantly degrade a program's performance. They must thus be reduced to a minimum. In this article, we present a novel, aggressive approach for avoiding unnecessary remappings, which works by eliminating partially dead and partially redundant distribution changes. Basically, this approach evolves from extending and combining two algorithms for these optimizations, each achieving optimal results on its own. In distinction to the sequential setting, the data-parallel setting leads naturally to a family of algorithms of varying power and efficiency, allowing requirement-customized solutions. The power and flexibility of the new approach are demonstrated by various examples, which range from typical HPF fragments to real-world programs. Performance measurements underline its importance and show its effectiveness on different hardware platforms and in different settings."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2002.1011416"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011416"","""",""Cost function";Programming profession;Program processors;Computer Society;Optimizing compilers;Computer architecture;Degradation;Measurement;Hardware;"Data analysis"","""",""13"","""",""42"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

In a broadcasting task, a source node sends the same message to all the nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce or eliminate the communication overhead of a broadcasting task by applying the concept of localized dominating sets. Their maintenance does not require any communication overhead in addition to maintaining positions of neighboring nodes. Retransmissions by only internal nodes in a dominating set is sufficient for reliable broadcasting. Existing dominating sets are improved by using node degrees instead of their ids as primary keys. We also propose to eliminate neighbors that already received the message and rebroadcast only if the list of neighbors that might need the message is nonempty. A retransmission after negative acknowledgements scheme is also described. The important features of the proposed algorithms are their reliability (reaching all nodes in the absence of message collisions), significant rebroadcast savings, and their localized and parameterless behavior. The reduction in communication overhead for the broadcasting task is measured experimentally. Dominating set based broadcasting, enhanced by a neighbor elimination scheme and highest degree key, provides reliable broadcast with /spl les/53 percent of node retransmissions (on random unit graphs with 100 nodes) for all average degrees d. Critical d is around 4, with <48 percent for /spl les/3, /spl les/40 percent for d/spl ges/10, and /spl les/20 percent for d/spl ges/25. The proposed methods are better than existing ones in all considered aspects: reliability, rebroadcast savings, and maintenance communication overhead. In particular, the cluster structure is inefficient for broadcasting because of considerable communication overhead for maintaining the structure and is also inferior in terms of rebroadcast savings."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.980024"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980024"","""",""Broadcasting";Intelligent networks;"Wireless networks"","""",""534"",""3"",""36"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

With the rapid advancement of CPU chips, memory and disk access speed improvements significantly lag behind advancement of CPU speed, increasing the penalty for data movement, such as page faults and I/O operations, relative to normal CPU operations. Aiming at reducing the memory resource contention caused by page faults and I/O activities, we have developed and examined load sharing policies by considering effective usage of global memory in addition to CPU load balancing in clusters. We study two types of application workloads: 1) Memory demands are known in advance or are predictable and 2) memory demands are unknown and dynamically changed during execution. Besides using workload traces with known memory demands, we have also made kernel instrumentation to collect different types of workload execution traces to capture dynamic memory access patterns.

The stations are assumed to have the computing power of a laptop computer and to be synchronous, in particular, they all run the same program, albeit on different data. We assume that a station is expending power while transmitting or receiving messages. As it turns out, one of the most effective energy-saving strategies is to mandate individual stations to power their transceiver off (i.e., go to sleep) whenever they are not transmitting or receiving messages. Suppose that the p stations of the BCM store collectively n items such that station S(i), (1 /spl les/ i /spl les/ p), stores s/sub i/ items. Each of the items has a unique destination which is the identity of the station to which the item must be routed. The goal is to route all the items to their destinations, while expending as little energy as possible. Since, in the worst case, each item must be transmitted at least once, every routing protocol must take at least n time slots to terminate. Furthermore, station S(i), (1 /spl les/ i /spl les/ p), must be awake for at least s/sub i/ + d/sub i/ time slots, where d/sub i/ denotes the number of items destined for S(i). Since, in the BCM, every station is within transmission range from every other station, the design of energy-efficient protocols is highly nontrivial. An additional complication stems from the inherent asymmetry of the routing problem: no destination knows the identity of the sender, precluding a priori arrangements between senders and receivers. The main contribution of this work is to present an energy-efficient routing protocol for the single-channel, p-station BCM. We show that for every f /spl ges/ 1, the task of routing n items in this model can be completed with probability exceeding 1 - 1/f, in n + O(q + ln f) time slots and that no station S(i), (1 /spl les/ i /spl les/ p), has to be awake for more than s/sub i/ + d/sub i/ + O(q/sub i/ + r/sub i/ log p + log f) time slots, where q/sub i/ is the number of stations that have items destined for S(i), q = q/sub 1/ + q/sub 2/ +/spl middot//spl middot//spl middot/+ q/sub p/, and r/sub i/ is the number of stations for which S(i) has items.

Fairness is an intuitively desirable property in the allocation of bandwidth available on a link among traffic flows of different users that share the link. Strict fairness in traffic scheduling can improve the isolation between users, offer a more predictable performance and improve performance by eliminating some bottlenecks. This paper presents a simple, fair, efficient, and easily implementable scheduling discipline, called Elastic Round Robin (ERR), designed to satisfy the unique needs of wormhole switching, which is popular in interconnection networks of parallel systems. In spite of the constraints of wormhole switching imposed on the design, ERR is also suitable for use in Internet routers and has better fairness and performance characteristics than previously known scheduling algorithms of comparable efficiency, including Deficit Round Robin and Surplus Round Robin. In this paper, we prove that ERR is efficient, with a per-packet work complexity of O(1). We analytically derive the relative fairness bound of ERR, a popular metric used to measure fairness. We also derive the bound on the start-up latency experienced by a new flow that arrives at an ERR scheduler. Finally, this paper presents simulation results comparing the fairness and performance characteristics of ERR with other scheduling disciplines of comparable efficiency."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.993210"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993210"","""",""Scheduling algorithm";"Round robin"","""",""80"",""1"",""28"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

HiPER is a proof-of-concept vehicle for efficient implementations of routing, switching, and error control mechanisms. It combines mad postman (bit-pipelined) switching with dimension-order routing, producing a low-latency routing router that is less sensitive to message distance than a word parallel crossbar router. To maintain robust communication as link speeds increase and link power budgets decrease, HiPER employs flit-level hop-by-hop retransmission of erroneous flits, which provides builtin error control at the network level.

However, very few switches have been designed that are suitable for more than one of these application domains. Such a switch must offer both extremely low latency and very high throughput for a variety of different message sizes. While some architectures with output queuing have been shown to perform extremely well in terms of throughput, their performance can suffer when used in systems where a significant portion of the packets are extremely small. On the other hand, architectures with input queuing offer limited throughput or require fairly complex and centralized arbitration that increases latency. In this paper, we present a new input queue-based switch architecture called HIPIQS (HIgh-Performance Input-Queued Switch). It offers low latency for a range of message sizes and provides throughput comparable to that of output queuing approaches. Furthermore, it allows simple and distributed arbitration. HIPIQS uses a dynamically allocated multiqueue organization, pipelined access to multibank input buffers, and small cross-point buffers to deliver high performance. Our simulation results show that HIPIQS can deliver performance close to that of output queuing approaches over a range of message sizes, system sizes, and traffic. The switch architecture can therefore be used to build high performance switches that are useful for both parallel system interconnects and for building computer networks."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.993207"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993207"","""",""Switches";Throughput;Delay;LAN interconnection;Local area networks;Wide area networks;Computational modeling;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;"Computer architecture"","""",""12"",""4"",""24"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;

List-scheduling algorithms schedule tasks in order of their priority. This priority can be computed either (1) statically, before the scheduling, or (2) dynamically, during the scheduling. In this paper, we show that list scheduling with statically-computed priorities (LSSP) can be performed at a significantly lower cost than existing approaches, without sacrificing performance. Our approach is general, i.e. it can be applied to any LSSP algorithm. The low complexity is achieved by using low-complexity methods for the most time-consuming parts in list-scheduling algorithms, i.e. processor selection and task selection, preserving the criteria used in the original algorithms. We exemplify our method by applying it to the MCP (Modified Critical Path) algorithm. Using an extension of this method, we can also reduce the time complexity of a particular class of list scheduling with dynamic priorities (LSDP) [including algorithms such as DLS (Dynamic Level Scheduling), ETF (Earliest Task First) and ERT (Earliest Ready Task)]. Our results confirm that the modified versions of the list-scheduling algorithms obtain a performance comparable to their original versions, yet at a significantly lower cost.

To reduce the effect of failures on an application executing on a failure-prone system, matching and scheduling algorithms which minimize not only the execution time but also the probability of failure of the application must be devised. However, because of the conflicting requirements, it is not possible to minimize both of the objectives at the same time. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop matching and scheduling algorithms which account for both the execution time and the reliability of the application. This goal is achieved by modifying an existing matching and scheduling algorithm. The reliability of resources is taken into account using an incremental cost function proposed in this paper and the new algorithm is referred to as the reliable dynamic level scheduling algorithm. The incremental cost function can be defined based on one of the three cost functions developed here. These cost functions are unique in the sense that they are not restricted to tree-based networks and a specific matching and scheduling algorithm. The simulation results confirm that the proposed incremental cost function can be incorporated into matching and scheduling algorithms to produce schedules where the effect of failures of machines and network resources on the execution of the application is reduced and the execution time of the application is minimized as well."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.993209"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993209"","""",""Scheduling algorithm"","""",""144"",""7"",""28"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We explore the feasibility of providing QoS in wormhole switched routers, which are widely used in designing scalable, high-performance cluster interconnects. In particular, we are interested in supporting multimedia video streams with CBR and VBR traffic, in addition to the conventional best-effort traffic. The proposed MediaWorm router uses a rate-based bandwidth allocation mechanism, called Fine-Grained VirtualClock (FGVC), to schedule network resources for different traffic classes. Our simulation results on an 8-port router indicate that it is possible to provide jitter-free delivery to VBR/CBR traffic up to an input load of 70-80 percent of link bandwidth and the presence of best-effort traffic has no adverse effect on real-time traffic. Although the MediaWorm router shows a slightly lower performance than a pipelined circuit switched (PCS) router, commercial success of wormhole switching, coupled with simpler and cheaper design, makes it an attractive alternative. Simulation of a (2/spl times/2) fat-mesh using this router shows performance comparable to that of a single switch and suggests that clusters designed with appropriate bandwidth balance between links can provide required performance for different types of traffic."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2002.1158264"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158264"","""",""Traffic control";Telecommunication traffic;Streaming media;Bandwidth;Switching circuits;Switches;Quality of service;Integrated circuit interconnections;Channel allocation;"Personal communication networks"","""",""10"",""1"",""46"",""IEEE"",""6 Jan 2003"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;

To ensure efficient execution on a distributed system, the heterogeneities in the processor and network performance must be taken into consideration in the partitioning process; equal size subdomains and small cut set size, which results from conventional mesh partitioning, are no longer the primary goals. In this paper, we address various issues related to mesh partitioning for distributed systems. These issues include the metric used to compare different partitions, efficiency of the application executing on a distributed system, and the advantage of exploiting heterogeneity in network performance. We present a tool called PART, for automatic mesh partitioning for distributed systems. The novel feature of PART is that it considers heterogeneities in the application and the distributed system. Simulated annealing is used in PART to perform the backtracking search for desired partitions. While it is well-known that simulated annealing is computationally intensive, we describe the parallel version of simulated annealing that is used with PART. The results of the parallelization exhibit superlinear speedup in most cases and nearly perfect speedup for the remaining cases. Experimental results are also presented for partitioning regular and irregular finite element meshes for an explicit, nonlinear finite element application, called WHAMS2D, executing on a distributed system consisting of two IBM SPs with different processors. The results from the regular problems indicate a 33 to 46 percent increase in efficiency when processor performance is considered as compared to the conventional even partitioning. The results indicate a 5 to 15 percent increase in efficiency when network performance is considered as compared to considering only processor performance;" this is significant given that the optimal improvement is 15 percent for this application.

Traditional HPC-style communication libraries, such as MPI, offer good performance, but are not intended for loosely-coupled systems. Object- and metadata-based approaches like XML offer the needed plug-and-play flexibility, but with significantly lower performance.

Finally, the algorithm is conceptually simple and symmetrical for every message and every node so that it can be easily implemented in hardware and achieves the near-optimum in practice."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.983941"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983941"","""",""Broadcasting";Multidimensional systems;Distributed computing;Senior members;Computer Society;Application software;Telecommunication traffic;Communication switching;Delay effects;"Hardware"","""",""25"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

The agents of the system span across all the machines of a cluster. Just like the case of traditional distributed systems, load balancing becomes an area of concern. With different characteristics between ordinary processes and agents, it is both interesting and useful to investigate whether conventional load-balancing strategies are also applicable and sufficient to cope with the newly emerging needs, such as coping with temporally continuous agents, devising a performance metric for multiagent systems, and taking into account the vast amount of communication and interaction among agent. This paper discusses the above issues with reference to agent properties and load balancing techniques and outlines the space of load-balancing design choices in the arena of multiagent computing. In view of the special agent characteristics, a novel communication-based load-balancing algorithm is proposed, implemented, and evaluated. The proposed algorithm works by associating a credit value with each agent. The credit of an agent depends on its affinity to a machine, its current workload, its communication behavior, and mobility, etc. When a load imbalance occurs, the credits of all agents are examined and an agent with a lower credit value is migrated to relatively lightly loaded machine in the system.

Two classes of decentralized consensus protocols have been studied before: the one without an initiator and the one with an initiator. While the one without an initiator has been well studied in the literature, it is noted that the prior protocols with an initiator mainly relied upon the one without an initiator and thus did not fully exploit the intrinsic properties of having an initiator. By exploiting the concept of multilayered execution, we develop in this paper an efficient multilayered decentralized consensus protocol for a distributed system with an initiator. By adapting itself to the number of nodes in the system, the proposed protocol can determine a proper layer for execution and reach the consensus in the minimal numbers of message steps while incurring a much smaller number of messages than required by prior works. Several illustrative examples are given and performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is conducted to provide many insights into the problem studied. It is shown that the decentralized consensus protocols developed in this paper for the case of having an initiator significantly outperform prior schemes. Specifically, it is proven that (1) the ratio of the average number of messages incurred by the proposed algorithm to that by the prior method approaches zero as the number of nodes increases and (2) the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the message number required by the proposed algorithm and that of the optimal one are asymptotically of the same complexity with respect to the number of nodes in the system, showing the very important advantage of the proposed algorithm."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2002.1028435"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028435"","""",""Protocols";Performance analysis;Distributed computing;Message passing;Distributed processing;Availability;Costs;Clocks;Synchronization;"Broadcasting"","""",""1"","""",""18"",""IEEE"",""7 Nov 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;

For supernode transformations on algorithms with perfectly nested loops and uniform dependencies, we prove the optimality of a constant linear schedule vector and give a necessary and sufficient condition for optimal relative side lengths.

The main difference between the RAPWBN model and other existing reconfigurable parallel processing systems is that the bus width of each network is bounded within the range [2,[/spl radic/(N)]]. Such a strategy not only saves the silicon area of the chip as well as increases the computational power enormously, but the strategy also allows the execution speed of the proposed algorithms to be tuned by the bus bandwidth. To demonstrate the computational power of the RAPWBN, the channel-assignment problem is derived in this paper. For the channel-assignment problem with N pairs of components, we first design an O(T + [N//spl omega/]) time parallel algorithm using 2N processors with a 2N-row by 2N-column bus network, where the bus width of each bus network is /spl omega/-bit for 2 /spl les/ /spl omega/ /spl les/ [/spl radic/N] and T = [log/sub /spl omega//N] + 1.

In the proposed scheme, locking is made optional in the sense that a user may update any part of the document without necessarily requesting a lock. In the face of high communication latency in the Internet environment, responsive locking is achieved by granting the permit to the user for updating the data region immediately after issuing a locking request. Moreover, multiple fine-grain locks can be placed on different regions inside a document to allow concurrent and mutually exclusive editing on the same document. Protocols and algorithms for locking conflict resolution and consistency maintenance are devised to address special technical issues involved in optional and responsive fine-grain locking.

In a serverless cluster of computers, all distributed local disks can be integrated as a distributed-software redundant array of independent disks (ds-RAID) with a single I/O space. We report the new RAID-x design and its benchmark performance results. The advantage of RAID-x comes mainly from its orthogonal striping and mirroring (OSM) architecture. The bandwidth is enhanced with distributed striping across local and remote disks, while the reliability comes from orthogonal mirroring on local disks at the background. Our RAID-x design is experimentally compared with the RAID-5, RAID-10, and chained-declustering RAID through benchmarking on a research Linux cluster at USC. Andrew and Bonnie benchmark results are reported on all four disk-array architectures. Cooperative disk drivers and Linux extensions are developed to enable not only the single I/O space, but also the shared virtual memory and global file hierarchy. We reveal the effects of traffic rate and stripe unit size on I/O performance. Through scalability and overhead analysis, we find the strength of RAID-x in three areas: 1) improved aggregate I/O bandwidth especially for parallel writes, 2) orthogonal mirroring with low software overhead, and 3) enhanced scalability in cluster I/O processing. Architectural strengths and weakness of all four ds-RAID architectures are evaluated comparatively.

For regular domain problems (such as simple matrix manipulations), this task may seem trivial. However, communication costs in message-passing programs often depend significantly on the memory layout of data blocks to be transmitted. As a consequence, straightforward domain decompositions may be non-optimal. In this paper, we introduce a new point-to-point communication model, called P-3PC (Parameterized model based on the Three Paths of Communication), that is specifically designed to overcome this problem. In comparison with related models (e.g. LogGP), P-3PC is similar in complexity, but more accurate in many situations. Although the model is aimed at MPI's standard point-to-point operations, it is applicable to similar message-passing definitions as well. The effectiveness of the model is tested in a framework for automatic parallelization of low-level image processing applications. Experiments are performed on two Beowulf-type systems, each having a different interconnection network and a different MPI implementation.

Although such benefits accrue from the use of middleware, careful consideration of system architecture is required to achieve high performance. Based on implementation and measurements made on the system, this paper is concerned with the impact of client-server interaction architecture on the performance of CORBA Systems. CORBA or Common Object Request Broker Architecture, proposed by the Object Management Group, is one of the commonly used standards for middleware architectures. Using a commercially available CORBA compliant ORB software called ORBeline, four different architectures were designed and implemented for client-server interaction on a network of workstations. In the Handle-Driven ORB (H-ORB) architecture, the client gets the address of the server from the agent and communicates with the server directly. In the Forwarding ORB (F-ORB) architecture the client request is automatically forwarded by the agent to the appropriate server which then returns the results of the computations to the client directly. In the Process Planner (P-ORB) architecture, the agent combines request forwarding with concurrent invocation of multiple servers for complex requests that require the services of multiple servers. The Adaptive ORB (A-ORB) combines the functionalities of both the H-ORB and the F-ORB and can switch dynamically from an H-ORB mode to an F-ORB mode and vice versa, depending on the load condition. Our measurements show that the differences among the performances of these architectures change with a change in the workload. The paper will report on the relative performances of these four architectures under different workload conditions. The results provide insights into system behavior for designers as well as users of systems. In particular, the impact of internode delays, message size, and request service times on the latency and scalability attributes of these architectures is analyzed.

The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.993206"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993206"","""",""Processor scheduling"","""",""2281"",""7"",""31"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In general, after sorting all subsets of both relations, the proposed algorithms permute every sorted subset of relation S to each processor in turn, where it is joined with the local subset of relation R. To permute the subsets of S efficiently, we propose two data permutation approaches, namely, the shifting approach which permutes the data recursively from lower dimensions to higher dimensions and the Hamiltonian-cycle approach which first constructs a Hamiltonian cycle on the mesh and then permutes the data along this cycle by repeatedly transferring data from each processor to its successor. We apply the shifting approach to meshes with different storage capacities which results in two different join algorithms. The basic shifting join (BASHJ) algorithm can minimize the number of subsets stored temporarily at a processor, but requires a large number of data transmissions, while the buffering shifting join (BUSHJ) algorithm can achieve a high parallelism and minimize the number of data transmissions, but requires a large number of subsets stored at each processor."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.995821"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995821"","""",""Buffer storage";Concurrent computing;Data communication;Parallel algorithms;Sorting;"Parallel processing"","""",""4"","""",""19"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

A single-copy NVRAM cache creates a single point of failure while a dual-copy NVRAM cache is very expensive because of the high cost of NVRAM. This paper presents a new cache architecture called RAPID-Cache for Redundant, Asymmetrically Parallel, and Inexpensive Disk Cache. A typical RAPID-Cache consists of two redundant write buffers on top of a disk system. One of the buffers is a primary cache made of RAM or NVRAM and the other is a backup cache containing a two-level hierarchy: a small NVRAM buffer on top of a log disk. The small NVRAM buffer combines small write data and writes them into the log disk in large sizes. By exploiting the locality property of I/O accesses and taking advantage of well-known Log-structured File Systems, the backup cache has nearly equivalent write performance as the primary RAM cache. The read performance of the backup cache is not as critical because normal read operations are performed through the primary RAM cache and reads from the backup cache happen only during error recovery periods. The RAPID-Cache presents an asymmetric architecture with a fast-write-fast-read RAM being a primary cache and a fast-write-slow-read NVRAM-disk hierarchy being a backup cache. The asymmetrically parallel architecture and an algorithm that separates actively accessed data from inactive data in the cache virtually eliminate the garbage collection overhead, which are the major problems associated with previous solutions such as Log-structured File Systems and Disk Caching Disk. The asymmetric cache allows cost-effective designs for very large write caches for high-end parallel disk systems that would otherwise have to use dual-copy, costly NVRAM caches. It also makes it possible to implement reliable write caching for low-end disk I/O systems since the RAPID-Cache makes use of inexpensive disks to perform reliable caching. Our analysis and trace-driven simulation results show that the RAPID-Cache has significant reliability/cost advantages over conventional single NVRAM write caches and has great cost advantages over dual-copy NVRAM caches. The RAPID-Cache architecture opens a new dimension for disk system designers to exercise trade-offs among performance, reliability, and cost."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.993208"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993208"","""",""Cache storage"","""",""18"",""3"",""26"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although the QoS provisioning problem arises in wireline networks as well, mobility of hosts, scarcity of bandwidth, and channel fading make QoS provisioning a challenging task in wireless networks. It has been noticed that multimedia applications can tolerate and gracefully adapt to transient fluctuations in the QoS that they receive from the network. The management of such adaptive multimedia applications is becoming a new research area in wireless networks. As it turns out, the additional flexibility afforded by the ability of multimedia applications to tolerate and adapt to transient changes in the QoS parameters can be exploited by protocol designers to significantly improve the overall performance of wireless systems. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel, rate-based, borrowing scheme for QoS provisioning in high-speed cellular networks carrying multimedia traffic. Our scheme attempts to allocate the desired bandwidth to every multimedia connection originating in a cell or being handed off to the cell. The novelty of our scheme is that, in case of insufficient bandwidth, in order not to deny service to requesting connections (new or hand-off), bandwidth will be borrowed, on a temporary basis, from existing connections. Our borrowing scheme guarantees that no connection gives up more than its fair share of bandwidth, in the sense that the amount of bandwidth borrowed from a connection is proportional to its tolerance to bandwidth loss. Importantly, our scheme ensures that the borrowed bandwidth is promptly returned to the degraded connections. Extensive simulation results show that our rate-based QoS provisioning scheme outperforms the best previously known schemes in terms of call dropping probability, call blocking probability, and bandwidth utilization."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/71.983943"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983943"","""",""Bandwidth";Land mobile radio cellular systems;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;Teleconferencing;Quality of service;Fading;Fluctuations;Multimedia systems;"Wireless application protocol"","""",""97"","""",""20"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;

This paper proposes the concept of a priority cap to bound the maximum number of priority inversions in multiprocessor-based real-time database systems to meet transaction deadlines. We also explore the concept of two-version data to increase the system concurrency level and to explore the abundant computing resources of multiprocessor computer systems. The capability of the proposed methodology is evaluated in a multiprocessor real-time database system under different workloads, database sizes and processor configurations. It is shown that the benefits of the priority cap in reducing the blocking time of urgent transactions are far greater than the losses involved in committing less urgent transactions.

False sharing and cache conflicts cause traditional column-major or row-major array layouts to incur high variability in memory system performance as matrix size varies. This paper investigates the use of recursive array layouts to improve performance and reduce variability. Previous work on recursive matrix multiplication is extended to examine several recursive array layouts and three recursive algorithms: standard matrix multiplication and the more complex algorithms of Strassen (1969) and Winograd. While recursive layouts significantly outperform traditional layouts (reducing execution times by a factor of 1.2-2.5) for the standard algorithm, they offer little improvement for Strassen's and Winograd's algorithms. For a purely sequential implementation, it is possible to reorder computation to conserve memory space and improve performance between 10 percent and 20 percent. Carrying the recursive layout down to the level of individual matrix elements is shown to be counterproductive";" a combination of recursive layouts down to canonically ordered matrix tiles instead yields higher performance. Five recursive layouts with successively increasing complexity of address computation are evaluated and it is shown that addressing overheads can be kept in control even for the most computationally demanding of these layouts."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2002.1058095"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058095"","""",""Linear algebra";Parallel processing;Data structures;Matrix decomposition;System performance;Interference;"Robust control"","""",""56"",""1"",""58"",""IEEE"",""10 Dec 2002"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;

We assume that the stations are identical and cannot be distinguished by serial or manufacturing number. The leader election problem asks to designate one of the stations as leader. In this work, we focus on single-channel, single-hop radio networks. We assume that time is slotted and all transmissions occur at slot boundaries. In each time slot, the stations transmit on the channel with some probability until, eventually, one of the stations is declared leader. A leader election protocol is said to be uniform if, in each time slot, every station transmits with the same probability. In a seminal paper, Willard (1986) presented a uniform leader election protocol for single-channel single-hop radio stations terminating in log log n+o(log log n) expected time slots. It was open for more than 15 years whether Willard's protocol featured the same time performance with """"high probability."""" One of our main contributions is to show that, unfortunately, this is not the case.

The highlight of this work is a novel uniform leader election protocol that terminates, with probability exceeding 1-1/f, in log log n+o(log log n)+O(log f) time slots.
