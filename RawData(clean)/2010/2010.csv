Location cloaking has been proposed to blur users' accurate locations with cloaked regions. Although various cloaking algorithms have been studied, none of the prior work has explored the impact of cloaking on the bandwidth usage of requested services. In this paper, we develop an innovative result-aware location cloaking approach, called 2PASS. Based on the notion of Voronoi cells, 2PASS minimizes the number of objects to request, and hence, the bandwidth while meeting the same privacy requirement. The core component of 2PASS is a lightweight WAG-tree index, based on which efficient and secure client and server procedures are designed. Through threat analysis and experimental results, we argue that 2PASS is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various metrics, such as query response time and bandwidth consumption.

To address this problem, we explore a novel cross-layer approach to improve the overall performance of CVEs over MANETs.

Power constraints make impractical to rely on broadcasts (as, for example, Token-CMP does) or any other brute-force method for keeping cache coherence, and directory-based cache coherence protocols are currently being employed. Unfortunately, directory protocols introduce indirection to access directory information, which negatively impacts performance. In this work, we present DiCo-CMP, a novel cache coherence protocol especially suited to future many-core tiled CMP architectures. In DiCo-CMP, the task of storing up-to-date sharing information and ensuring ordered accesses for every memory block is assigned to the cache that must provide the block on a miss. Therefore, DiCo-CMP reduces the miss latency compared to a directory protocol by sending requests directly to the cache that provides the block in a cache miss. These latency reductions result in improvements in execution time of up to 6 percent, on average, over a directory protocol.

Recently, the WiMedia Alliance has announced the PHY/MAC specification together with the common radio platform for UWB WPANs. The WiMedia MAC uses the contention-free reservation-based access, which supports isochronous traffic with distributed reservation protocol (DRP), and the contention-based access, which provides service differentiation for best effort and variable-rate real-time traffic with prioritized channel access (PCA), similar to the enhanced distributed coordinated access (EDCA) in IEEE 802.11e. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and show that with the currently recommended parameter setting, EDCA cannot provide adequate QoS. In particular, without responding to the system dynamics (e.g., taking account of the number of active stations in each class), EDCA cannot allocate bandwidth in a deterministic proportional manner and the system bandwidth is underutilized. After identifying the deficiency of EDCA, we propose an enhanced QoS-provisioning framework for the PCA scheme that dynamically controls channel access to adjust allocated bandwidth depending on the change of application's bit rate, i.e., variable-rate real-time traffic. We show that in this framework, 1) variable-rate real-time traffic is adaptively guaranteed of deterministic bandwidth via a contention-based reservation access method"; 2) best effort traffic is provided with deterministic proportional QoS;" and 3) moreover, the bandwidth utilization in PCA is maximized. By deterministic proportional QoS, we mean that the proposed protocol will maintain the ratio, rj, of per-station throughput attained by a station of class j to that attained by a station of class 1 at the targeted value, and yet, the real amount of network bandwidth is changing according to the current available network bandwidth. We have also validated and evaluated the QoS provisioning capability and practicality of the proposed PCA framework both via simulation and an empirical study with the Multiband Atheros Driver for WiFi (MADWifi) Linux driver for Wireless LAN devices with the Atheros chipset."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.32"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5406512"",""Quality of service (QoS)";PCA;UWB WPANs;802.11e EDCA;MAC;"modeling."",""Channel allocation";Ultra wideband technology;Bandwidth;Quality of service;Principal component analysis;Traffic control;Physical layer;Media Access Protocol;Access protocols;"Bit rate"","""",""7"",""1"",""36"",""IEEE"",""5 Feb 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;

TCP fails to be a suitable method of bulk data transfer in many of these applications, giving rise to new classes of protocols designed to circumvent TCP's shortcomings. It is typical in these high-performance applications, however, that the system hardware is simply incapable of saturating the bandwidths supported by the network infrastructure. When the bottleneck for data transfer occurs in the system itself and not in the network, it is critical that the protocol scales gracefully to prevent buffer overflow and packet loss. It is therefore necessary to build a high-speed protocol adaptive to the performance of each system by including a dynamic performance-based flow control. This paper develops such a protocol, Performance Adaptive UDP (henceforth PA-UDP), which aims to dynamically and autonomously maximize performance under different systems. A mathematical model and related algorithms are proposed to describe the theoretical basis behind effective buffer and CPU management. A novel delay-based rate-throttling model is also demonstrated to be very accurate under diverse system latencies. Based on these models, we implemented a prototype under Linux, and the experimental results demonstrate that PA-UDP outperforms other existing high-speed protocols on commodity hardware in terms of throughput, packet loss, and CPU utilization.

A typical scenario where network coding offers unique advantages is a multicast network where a source node generates messages and multiple receivers collect the messages. In a multicast network, linear network codes are preferred due to its sufficiency and simplicity. In this paper, we propose an approach to transforming the linear coding problem into a graph theory problem. By utilizing hypergraphs, we model the linear codes by constructing a pseudodual graph of the multicast network. Then, a valid linear code is equivalent to a cover in the pseudodual graph satisfying some constraints. By iterative refinements, an eligible cover can be found in polynomial time. Moreover, we propose several preprocessing algorithms to further reduce the computation time required by the iterative refinements by reducing the graph size before transformation. An important contribution of this work is that the proposed approach can be readily extended to solve many minimal network coding problems. By assigning different weights to edges, minimal network coding problems are reduced to the shortest path problem in the pseudodual graph. Our simulation results show that the proposed preprocessing algorithms can reduce the computation time by about 40-50 percent in a medium size multicast network compared to the scheme without preprocessing algorithms, and the throughput of the system with network coding is 25 percent higher than that with the traditional approach of multiple multicast trees."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.144"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226622"",""Network coding";linear coding;multicast network;"hypergraph."",""Network coding";Multicast algorithms;Linear code;Routing;Encoding;Graph theory;Polynomials;Iterative algorithms;Shortest path problem;"Computational modeling"","""",""20"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""28 Aug 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

We apply Savitzky-Golay filter to train a sequence of confidence windows. The purpose is to smooth the prediction process from being disturbed by load fluctuations. We present a new adaptive hybrid method (AHModel) for load prediction guided by trained confidence windows. We test the effectiveness of this new prediction scheme with real-life workload traces on the AuverGrid and Grid5000 in France. Both theoretical and experimental results are reported in this paper. As the lookahead span increases from 10 to 50 steps (5 minutes per step), the AHModel predicts the grid workload with a mean-square error (MSE) of 0.04-0.73 percent, compared with 2.54-30.2 percent in using the static point value autoregression (AR) prediction method. The significant gain in prediction accuracy makes the new model very attractive to predict Grid performance. The model was proved especially effective to predict large workload that demands very long execution time, such as exceeding 4 hours on the Grid5000 over 5,000 processors.

Most current file replication methods replicate files in all nodes or two end points on a client-server query path. However, these methods either have low effectiveness or come at a cost of high overhead. File replication in server side enhances replica hit rate, hence, lookup efficiency but produces overloaded nodes and cannot significantly reduce query path length. File replication in client side could greatly reduce query path length, but cannot guarantee high replica hit rate to fully utilize replicas. Though replication along query path solves these problems, it comes at a high cost of overhead due to more replicas and produces underutilized replicas. This paper presents an Efficient and Adaptive Decentralized (EAD) file replication algorithm that achieves high query efficiency and high replica utilization at a significantly low cost. EAD enhances the utilization of file replicas by selecting query traffic hubs and frequent requesters as replica nodes, and dynamically adapting to nonuniform and time-varying file popularity and node interest. Unlike current methods, EAD creates and deletes replicas in a decentralized self-adaptive manner while guarantees high replica utilization. Theoretical analysis shows the high performance of EAD. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EAD in comparison with other approaches in both static and dynamic environments. It dramatically reduces the overhead of file replication, and yields significant improvements on the efficiency and effectiveness of file replication in terms of query efficiency, replica hit rate, and overloaded nodes reduction."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.127"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196668"",""Peer-to-peer system";distributed hash table;file sharing system;"file replication."",""Peer to peer computing";Costs;File servers;Traffic control;Performance analysis;IP networks;Software libraries;Large-scale systems;"Internet"","""",""48"",""1"",""41"",""IEEE"",""7 Aug 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we consider an ISP-friendly file distribution protocol which uses the “exploiting-the-locality principle” (ELP) to reduce the cross-ISP traffic. To show its benefit, we derive an upper and lower bound of cross-ISP traffic for the protocols which rely on ELP and show that the cross-ISP traffic can be reduced significantly when the number of peers within an ISP increases. To carry out realistic study, we design and implement our ISP-friendly protocol (which is compatible with the current BitTorrent protocol) and carry out large scale experiments on PlanetLab to measure the reduction of the cross ISP-traffic and the file downloading time.

Memory accesses are classified at compile time into two classes: high locality and irregular. Our approach then steers the memory references toward one of two specific cache structures optimized for their respective access pattern. The specific cache structures are optimized to enable high-level compiler optimizations to aggressively unroll loops, reorder cache references, and/or transform surrounding loops so as to practically eliminate the software-cache overhead in the innermost loop. The cache design enables automatic prefetch and modulo scheduling transformations. Performance evaluation indicates that optimized software-cache structures combined with the proposed prefetch techniques translate into speedup between 10 and 20 percent.

In previous configurations, networks were usually oversized and underutilized. In a smaller network, however, contention is more likely to occur and blocked packets cause head-of-line (HoL) blocking among the rest of the packets, spreading congestion quickly. The best-known solution to HoL blocking is Virtual Output Queues (VOQs). However, the cost of implementing VOQs increases quadratically with the number of output ports in the network, making it unpractical. The situation is aggravated when several priorities and/or Quality of Service (QoS) levels must be supported. Therefore, a more scalable and cost-effective solution is required to reduce or eliminate HoL blocking. In this paper, we present a family of methodologies, referred to as Destination-Based Buffer Management (DBBM), to reduce/eliminate the HoL blocking effect on interconnection networks. DBBM efficiently uses the resources (mainly memory queues) of the network. These methodologies are comprehensively evaluated in terms of throughput, scalability, and fairness. Results show that using the DBBM strategy, with a reduced number of queues at each switch, it is possible to achieve roughly the same throughput as the VOQ mechanism. Moreover, all of the proposed strategies are designed in such a way that they can be used in any switch architecture. We compare DBBM with RECN, a sophisticated mechanism that eliminates HoL blocking in congestion situations. Our mechanism is able to achieve almost the same performance with very low logic requirements (in contrast with RECN)."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.63"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815231"",""Communication/networking and information technology";network architecture and design;network operating systems;distributed systems;"computer systems organization."",""Switches";Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Costs;Quality of service;Throughput;Energy management;Resource management;Energy consumption;Scalability;"Logic"","""",""37"","""",""32"",""IEEE"",""17 Apr 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

It is, therefore, essential to understand high-end application communication characteristics across a broad spectrum of computational methods, and utilize that insight to tailor interconnect designs to the specific requirements of the underlying codes. This work makes several unique contributions toward attaining that goal. First, we conduct one of the broadest studies to date of high-end application communication requirements, whose computational methods include: finite difference, lattice Boltzmann, particle-in-cell, sparse linear algebra, particle-mesh ewald, and FFT-based solvers. Using derived communication characteristics, we next present the fit-tree approach for designing network infrastructure that is tailored to application requirements. The fit-tree minimizes the component count of an interconnect without impacting application performance compared to a fully connected network.

Using ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to perform high-speed packet classification has become the de facto standard in the industry. TCAMs classify packets in constant time by comparing a packet with all classification rules of ternary encoding in parallel. Despite their high speed, TCAMs suffer from the well-known interval expansion problem. As packet classification rules usually have fields specified as intervals, converting such rules to TCAM-compatible rules may result in an explosive increase in the number of rules. This is not a problem if TCAMs have large capacities. Unfortunately, TCAMs have very limited capacity, and more rules means more power consumption and more heat generation for TCAMs. Even worse, the number of rules in packet classifiers have been increasing rapidly with the growing number of services deployed on the Internet. In this paper, we propose to address the interval expansion problem of TCAMs by removing redundant rules in classifiers. This equivalent transformation can significantly reduce the number of TCAM entries needed by a classifier. Our experiments on real-life classifiers show an average reduction of 58.2 percent in the number of TCAM entries by removing redundant rules. Given the logical interleaving nature of packet filtering rules, identifying redundant rules in classifiers is by no means trivial, and to achieve the guarantee of no redundant rules in resulting classifiers is even more challenging. In this paper, for the first time, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for identifying all redundant rules in a classifier. Based on this condition, we categorize redundant rules into upward redundant rules and downward redundant rules. Second, we present two algorithms for detecting and removing the two types of redundant rules, respectively. Third, we formally prove that the resulting classifiers have no redundant rules after running the two algorithms. Last, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-life and synthetic classifiers. The experimental results show that our redundancy removal algorithms are both effective and efficient."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2008.216"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641912"",""Packet classification";Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM);redundant rules.;Packet-switching networks;Routers;Packet Classification;Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM);"Redundant Rules"",""Web and internet services";IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Telecommunication traffic;Associative memory;Encoding;Explosives;Energy consumption;"Power generation"","""",""42"",""5"",""42"",""IEEE"",""10 Oct 2008"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

In addition, CASE is distributed as no centralized operation is required, and is scalable as both its time complexity and its message complexity are linearly proportional to the network size. The skeleton graph is extracted by partitioning the boundary of the sensor network to identify the skeleton points, then generating the skeleton arcs, connecting these arcs, and finally refining the coarse skeleton graph.

We propose a novel asymmetric cooperative cache approach, where the data requests are transmitted to the cache layer on every node, but the data replies are only transmitted to the cache layer at the intermediate nodes that need to cache the data. This solution not only reduces the overhead of copying data between the user space and the kernel space, it also allows data pipelines to reduce the end-to-end delay. We also study the effects of different MAC layers, such as 802.11-based ad hoc networks and multi-interface-multichannel-based mesh networks, on the performance of cooperative cache.

Two classes of correlation methods are considered, namely time-domain methods and frequency-domain methods. Based on our threat model and known strategies in existing mix networks, we perform extensive experiments to analyze the performance of mixes.

The paper proposes an internal clock synchronization algorithm which combines the gossip-based paradigm with a nature-inspired approach, coming from the coupled oscillators phenomenon, to cope with scale and churn. The algorithm works on the top of an overlay network and uses a uniform peer sampling service to fulfill each node's local view. Therefore, differently from clock synchronization protocols for small scale and static distributed systems, here, each node synchronizes regularly with only the neighbors in its local view and not with the whole system. An evaluation of the convergence speed and the synchronization error of the coupled-based internal clock synchronization algorithm has been carried out, showing how convergence time and the synchronization error depends on the coupling factor and the local view size. Moreover, the variation of the synchronization error with respect to churn and the impact of a sudden variation of the number of nodes have been analyzed to show the stability of the algorithm. In all these contexts, the algorithm shows nice performance and very good self-organizing properties. Finally, we showed how the assumption on the existence of a uniform peer-sampling service is instrumental for the good behavior of the algorithm and how, in system models where network delays are unbounded, a mean-based convergence function reaches a lower synchronization error than median-based convergence functions exploiting the number of averaged clock values."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.111"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161256"",""Peer-to-peer";internal clock synchronization;peer sampling;"overlay networks."",""Clocks";Synchronization;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Convergence;Centralized control;Oscillators;Sampling methods;Protocols;"Algorithm design and analysis"","""",""19"",""1"",""42"",""IEEE"",""10 Jul 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;

Cautious design of delegation mechanism must be in place as a building block of cross-domain cooperation, since the cooperation inevitably involves exchanging and sharing relevant patient data that are considered highly private and confidential. The delegation mechanism grants permission to and restricts access rights of a cooperating partner. Patients are unwilling to accept the EHR system unless their health data are guaranteed proper use and disclosure, which cannot be easily achieved without cross-domain authentication and fine-grained access control. In addition, revocation of the delegated rights should be possible at any time during the cooperation.

To identify application DoS attack, we propose a novel group testing (GT)-based approach deployed on back-end servers, which not only offers a theoretical method to obtain short detection delay and low false positive/negative rate, but also provides an underlying framework against general network attacks.

There are primarily two classes of existing algorithms for computing a global snapshot. Algorithms in the first class use control messages of size 0(1) but require O(N) space and O(N) messages per processor in a network with JV processors. Algorithms in the second class use control messages (such as rotating tokens with vector counter method) of size O(N), use multiple control messages per channel, or require recording of message history. As a result, algorithms in both of these classes are not efficient in large systems when the logical topology of the communication layer such as MPI is complete. In this paper, we propose three scalable algorithms for global snapshots: a grid-based, a tree-based, and a centralized algorithm. The grid-based algorithm uses O(N) space but only O(¿(N)) messages per processor each of size O(¿(N)). The tree-based and centralized algorithms use only O(1) size messages. The tree-based algorithm requires O(1) space and O(log N log(W/N)) messages per processor where W is the total number of messages in transit.

In these applications, in addition to individual sensor readings, statistical aggregates such as Min and Count over the readings of a group of sensor nodes are often needed. To conserve resources for sensor nodes, in-network strategies are adopted to process the aggregates. One primitive in-network aggregation strategy is the tree-based aggregation, where the aggregates are computed from leaves to the root of a spanning tree over a sensor network. However, a shortcoming with the tree-based aggregation is that it is not robust against communication failures, which are common in sensor networks. One of the solutions to overcome this shortcoming is to enable multipath routing, by which each node broadcasts its reading or a partial aggregate to multiple neighbors. However, multipath routing-based aggregation typically suffers from the problem of overcounting sensor readings. In this study, we propose two schemes based on the linear counting technique to deal with the overcounting problem. These two schemes process aggregates by statically and dynamically, respectively, allocating space for the use of the linear counting technique. Both schemes provide the same accuracy guarantee but involve different communication costs. Through extensive experiments with real-world and synthetic data, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of using these two schemes as solutions for processing aggregates in a sensor network. The experiments also show that the scheme that dynamically allocates the space often outperforms the other one in terms of energy conservation since it requires less space to satisfy an accuracy constraint."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.33"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5406513"",""Wireless sensor networks";query processing;distributed data structures;"reliability and robustness."",""Robustness";Aggregates;Routing;Computer networks;Broadcasting;Base stations;Costs;Energy conservation;Query processing;"Data structures"","""",""16"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""5 Feb 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

With the help of network coding, the total number of transmissions can be reduced compared to broadcasting using the same forwarding nodes without coding. We exploit the usage of directional antennas to network coding-based broadcasting to further reduce energy consumption. A node equipped with directional antennas can divide the omnidirectional transmission range into several sectors and turn some of them on for transmission. In the proposed scheme using a directional antenna, forwarding nodes selected locally only need to transmit broadcast messages, original or coded, to restricted sectors. We also study two extensions. The first extension applies network coding to both dynamic and static forwarding node selection approaches.

This paper proposes two multicast algorithms: the level channel assignment (LCA) algorithm and the multichannel multicast (MCM) to improve the throughput for multichannel and multi-interface mesh networks. The algorithms build efficient multicast trees by minimizing the number of relay nodes and total hop count distances of the trees. The algorithms use dedicated channel assignment strategies to reduce the interference to improve the network capacity.

The problem becomes more severe in heterogeneous networks with nonuniform and time-varying popular files. Existing DHT load balancing algorithms are mainly focused on the issues caused by node heterogeneity. To deal with skewed lookups, this paper presents an elastic routing table (ERT) mechanism for query load balancing, based on the observation that high-degree nodes tend to receive more traffic load. The mechanism allows each node to have a routing table of variable size corresponding to node capacities. The indegree and outdegree of the routing table can also be adjusted dynamically in response to the change of file popularity and network churn. Theoretical analysis proves that the routing table degree is bounded. The ERT mechanism facilitates locality-aware randomized query forwarding to further improve lookup efficiency. By relating query forwarding to a supermarket customer service model, we prove that a two-way randomized query forwarding policy should lead to an exponential improvement in query processing time over random walking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERT mechanism and its related query forwarding policy for congestion and query load balancing.

We formulate this problem as a multiround sensor dispatch problem and show it to be NP-complete. Then, we propose a centralized and a distributed heuristics to schedule mobile sensors' traveling paths. Our heuristics allow arbitrary numbers of mobile sensors and event locations in each round and have an energy-balanced concept in mind.

Maintaining neighborhood information for packet forwarding can achieve a high efficiency in geographic routing, but may not be appropriate for WSNs in highly dynamic scenarios where network topology changes frequently due to nodes mobility and availability. We propose a novel online routing scheme, called Energy-efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing (EBGR), which can provide loop-free, fully stateless, energy-efficient sensor-to-sink routing at a low communication overhead without the help of prior neighborhood knowledge. In EBGR, each node first calculates its ideal next-hop relay position on the straight line toward the sink based on the energy-optimal forwarding distance, and each forwarder selects the neighbor closest to its ideal next-hop relay position as the next-hop relay using the Request-To-Send/Clear-To-Send (RTS/CTS) handshaking mechanism. We establish the lower and upper bounds on hop count and the upper bound on energy consumption under EBGR for sensor-to-sink routing, assuming no packet loss and no failures in greedy forwarding. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected total energy consumption along a route toward the sink under EBGR approaches to the lower bound with the increase of node deployment density.

In this paper, we present a filter model to characterize the relationship among the factors of server capacity, request scheduling, and service quality for general input traffic. By the model, a server scheduler operates as an finite-duration impulse response (FIR) filter that transforms request processes into workload processes with the objective of minimizing load variation or overload probability, and meanwhile, without violating request response deadlines as defined in service-level agreements. We present a design and analysis of the filter for traffic with strong LRD in the frequency domain. Most Internet traffic has monotonically decreasing strength of variation functions over frequency. For this type of input traffic, we prove that optimal schedulers must have a convex structure. Uniform resource allocation is an extreme case of the convexity and is proved to be optimal for Poisson traffic. We integrate the convex structural principle with the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) discipline and show that the enhanced GPS policy improves the service quality significantly.

To reduce data access cost and delay, caching has been widely used as an important technique. The efficiency of data access in caching systems largely depends on the cost for maintaining cache consistency, which can be high in wireless ad hoc networks due to network dynamism. Therefore, to make better trade-off between cache consistency and the cost incurred, it would be highly desirable to provide users the flexibility in specifying consistency requirements for their applications. In this paper, we propose a general consistency model called Probabilistic Delta Consistency (PDC), which integrates the flexibility granted by existing consistency models, covering them as special cases. We also propose the Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP) algorithm which satisfies user-specified consistency requirements under the PDC model. The analytical model of FCPP is used to derive the balance of minimizing the consistency maintenance cost and ensuring the specified consistency requirement.

This paper is a step in that direction. It has two contributions. Considering a simple and general asynchronous system model where processes generate asynchronous pulses during which they send and receive messages, it first introduces an additional assumption that allows to elect an eventual leader in all the runs that satisfy that assumption. That assumption is captured by the notion of asynchronous intermittent rotating t-star. An x-star is made up of one process p (the center of the star) plus a sequence of sets of x processes (the successive points of the star), which satisfies some properties. Intuitively, the intermittent rotating t-star assumption means that there are a process p, a subset of pulse numbers pn, and associated sets of processes Q(pn) such that each process of Q(pn) receives from p a message sent in pulse pn in a timely manner or among the first (n-t) messages tagged pn it ever receives. The t-star is called rotating because the set Q(pn) is allowed to change with pn"; it is intermittent because it can disappear during finite periods;" it is asynchronous because the points of a star are not required to be simultaneously at the same pulse. (This assumption combines and generalizes several synchrony and time-free assumptions that have been previously proposed to elect an eventual leader, e.g., eventual t-source, eventual t-moving source, and message pattern assumption.) The second contribution of the paper is an algorithm that eventually elects a common leader in the systems that satisfy the asynchronous intermittent rotating t-star assumption. This algorithm enjoys, among others, two noteworthy properties. First, from a design point of view, it is simple. Second, from a cost point of view, only the pulse numbers increase without bound. This means that, even in infinite executions, be links timely or not (or have the corresponding sender crashed or not), all the other local variables (including the timers) and message fields have a finite domain."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.163"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374382"",""Assumption coverage";asynchronous system;distributed algorithm;eventual t-source;eventual leader;failure detector;fault tolerance;message pattern;moving source;omega;partial synchrony;process crash;system model;"timely link."",""Detectors";Computer crashes;Fault tolerant systems;Fault detection;Pulse generation;Costs;Distributed algorithms;Protocols;"Message passing"","""",""11"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""8 Jan 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";

Since the hierarchy is a complex distributed structure, PL-Gossip introduces special mechanisms for internode coordination and consistency enforcement. Yet, these mechanisms are seamlessly integrated within the basic gossiping framework. Through simulations and experiments with an actual embedded protocol implementation, we demonstrate that PL-Gossip maintains the hierarchy in a manner that addresses all the peculiarities of sensor networks. More specifically, it offers excellent opportunities for aggressive energy saving and facilitates provisioning energy harvesting infrastructure. In addition, it bootstraps and recovers the hierarchy after failures relatively fast while also being robust to message loss.

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks.

In this paper, we present iPASS, a novel mesh-based P2P VoD system, to address these challenges. Specifically, iPASS adopts a dynamic buffering-progress-based peering strategy to achieve high peer bandwidth utilization with low system maintenance cost. To provide incentives for peer uploading, iPASS employs a differentiated prefetching design that enables peers with higher contribution prefetch content at higher speed. A distributed adaptive taxation algorithm is developed to balance the system-wide QoE and service differentiations among heterogeneous peers. To assess the performance of iPASS, we built a detailed packet-level P2P VoD simulator and conducted extensive simulations.

Most consistency maintenance methods propagate update messages based on message spreading or a structure without considering file replication dynamism, leading to inefficient file update and hence high possibility of outdated file response. This paper presents an Integrated file Replication and consistency Maintenance mechanism (IRM) that integrates the two techniques in a systematic and harmonized manner. It achieves high efficiency in file replication and consistency maintenance at a significantly low cost. Instead of passively accepting replicas and updates, each node determines file replication and update polling by dynamically adapting to time-varying file query and update rates, which avoids unnecessary file replications and updates.

In addition to reducing operating costs, precisely controlling power consumption is an essential way to avoid system failures caused by power capacity overload or overheating due to increasing high server density. Control-theoretic techniques have recently shown a lot of promise for power management because of their better control performance and theoretical guarantees on control accuracy and system stability. However, existing work oversimplifies the problem by controlling a single server independently from others. As a result, at the enclosure level where multiple high-density servers are correlated by common workloads and share common power supplies, power cannot be shared to improve application performance. In this paper, we propose an enclosure-level power controller that shifts power among servers based on their performance needs, while controlling the total power of the enclosure to be lower than a constraint. Our controller features a rigorous design based on an optimal Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) control theory.

To organize a multicast overlay, a natural structure is a tree, which, however, is known vulnerable to end-hosts dynamics. Data-driven approaches address this problem by employing a mesh structure, which enables data exchanges among multiple neighbors, and thus, greatly improves the overlay resilience. It unfortunately suffers from an efficiency-delay trade-off, because data have to be pulled from mesh neighbors by using extra notifications periodically. In this paper, we closely examine the contributions of overlay nodes, and argue that performance of a mesh overlay closely depends on a small set of stable backbone nodes. This is validated through a real trace study on PPLive, the largest commercial application-layer live streaming system to date. Motivated by this observation, we then suggest a novel collaborative tree-mesh design that leverages both mesh and tree structures. The key idea is to identify a set of stable nodes to construct a tree-based backbone, called treebone, with most of the data being pushed over this backbone. These stable nodes, together with others, are further organized through an auxiliary mesh overlay, which facilitates the treebone to accommodate node dynamics and fully exploit the available bandwidth between overlay nodes. This hybrid design, referred to as mTreebone, brings a series of unique and critical design challenges. In particular, the identification of stable nodes and seamless data delivery using both push and pull methods. In this paper, we present optimized solutions to these problems, which reconcile the two overlays under a coherent framework with controlled overhead. We evaluate mTreebone through both simulations and PlanetLab experiments. The results demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of this hybrid solution in both static and dynamic scenarios."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.77"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967573"",""Application-layer multicast";overlay network;mesh;tree;"live streaming."",""Collaboration";Streaming media;Peer to peer computing;Vehicle dynamics;Spine;Tree data structures;IP networks;Resilience;Bandwidth;"Proposals"","""",""79"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""26 May 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;

The first model enables cooperation among caches that belong to different autonomous systems (ASs), while the second considers cooperation among caches deployed within the same AS. We analyze the potential gain of cooperative caching in these two models. To perform this analysis, we conduct an eight-month measurement study on a popular P2P system to collect traffic traces for multiple caches. Then, we perform extensive trace-based simulations to analyze different angles of cooperative caching schemes. Our results demonstrate that: 1) significant improvement in byte hit rate can be achieved using cooperative caching, 2) simple object replacement policies are sufficient to achieve that gain, and 3) the overhead imposed by cooperative caching is negligible. In addition, we develop an analytic model to assess the gain from cooperative caching in different settings.

Measurement results show that most downloading peers are patient as the average download session is usually very long. It is sometimes even longer than downloading from a dedicated server using a modem. Existing results in the literature indicate that the stochastic fluctuation and the heterogeneity in the service capacity of each peer are two of the major reasons that make the average download time far longer than expected. In those studies, it has been often assumed that there is only one downloading peer in the network, ignoring the interaction and competition among peers. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the interaction and competition among peers on downloading performance under stochastic, heterogeneous, and unstructured P2P settings, thereby greatly extending the existing results on stochastic P2P networks made only under a single downloading peer in the network. To analyze the average download time in a P2P network with multiple competing downloading peers, we first introduce the notion of system utilization tailored to a P2P network. We investigate the relationship among the average download time, system utilization, and the level of competition among downloading peers in a stochastic P2P network. We then derive an achievable lower bound on the average download time and propose algorithms to give the peers the minimum average download time. Our result can much improve the download performance compared to earlier results in the literature. The performance of the different algorithms is compared under NS-2 simulations.

In this paper, we present a parallel method integrating mutual information, data processing inequality, and statistical testing to detect significant dependencies between genes, and efficiently exploit parallelism inherent in such computations. We present a new method to carry out permutation testing for assessing statistical significance of interactions, while reducing its computational complexity by a factor of Θ(n2), where n is the number of genes.

In particular, the bidiagonal reduction of a general, dense matrix is very often used as a preprocessing step for calculating the Singular Value Decomposition. Furthermore, in the Top500 list of June 2008, 98 percent of the fastest parallel systems in the world were based on multicores. This confronts the scientific software community with both a daunting challenge and a unique opportunity. The challenge arises from the disturbing mismatch between the design of systems based on this new chip architecture-hundreds of thousands of nodes, a million or more cores, reduced bandwidth and memory available to cores-and the components of the traditional software stack, such as numerical libraries, on which scientific applications have relied for their accuracy and performance. The many-core trend has even more exacerbated the problem, and it becomes critical to efficiently integrate existing or new numerical linear algebra algorithms suitable for such hardware. By exploiting the concept of tile algorithms in the multicore environment (i.e., high level of parallelism with fine granularity and high-performance data representation combined with a dynamic data-driven execution), the band bidiagonal reduction presented here achieves 94 Gflop/s on a 12,000 × 12,000 matrix with 16 Intel Tigerton 2.4 GHz processors. The main drawback of the tile algorithms approach for the bidiagonal reduction is that the full reduction cannot be obtained in one stage.

While this ubiquitous computing paradigm brings great convenience for information access, it also raises concerns over potential intrusion into user location privacy. To protect location privacy, one typical approach is to cloak user locations into spatial regions based on user-specified privacy requirements, and to transform location-based queries into region-based queries. In this paper, we identify and address three new issues concerning this location cloaking approach. First, we study the representation of cloaking regions and show that a circular region generally leads to a small result size for region-based queries. Second, we develop a mobility-aware location cloaking technique to resist trace analysis attacks. Two cloaking algorithms, namely MaxAccu_Cloak and MinComm_Cloak, are designed based on different performance objectives. Finally, we develop an efficient polynomial algorithm for evaluating circular-region-based kNN queries. Two query processing modes, namely bulk and progressive, are presented to return query results either all at once or in an incremental manner. Experimental results show that our proposed mobility-aware cloaking algorithms significantly improve the quality of location cloaking in terms of an entropy measure without compromising much on query latency or communication cost. Moreover, the progressive query processing mode achieves a shorter response time than the bulk mode by parallelizing the query evaluation and result transmission."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.65"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840334"",""Location-based services";location privacy;query processing;"mobile computing."",""Privacy";Query processing;Delay;Ubiquitous computing;Protection;Resists;Algorithm design and analysis;Polynomials;Entropy;"Costs"","""",""68"",""2"",""27"",""IEEE"",""24 Apr 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;

Some of the latest proposals of network technologies, like Advanced Switching and InfiniBand, include in their specifications one of these schedulers. However, these table-based schedulers do not work properly with variable packet sizes, as is usually the case in current network technologies. We have proposed a new table-based scheduler, which we have called Deficit Table (DTable) scheduler, that works properly with variable packet sizes. Moreover, we have proposed a methodology to configure this table-based scheduler in such a way that it permits us to decouple the bounding between the bandwidth and latency assignments.

The novelty of the suggested representation is that the burstiness bound and the bound of long-term average rate are separately connected to the fractal dimension D that is the measure of the local self-similarity together with the small-scale factor r and the Hurst parameter H that is the measure of the long-range dependence (LRD) together with the large-scale factor a of traffic. More precisely, we obtain σ' = r2D-5σ and ρ' = a-H ρ, where σ is the conventional bound of burstiness and ρ the conventional bound of long-term average rate, respectively. Thus, the present bound (σ',ρ') takes the conventional bound, say (σ,ρ), as a special case when r = 1 and a = 1. Hence, the proposed representation provides us with a flexible way to tighten a traffic bound. Since we study the stochastically bounded modeling of traffic by taking into account the parameters in stochastic modeling, namely, D, H, r, and a, as well as the parameters in the deterministic modeling of traffic, i.e., σ and ρ, a new outlook regarding the stochastically bounded modeling of traffic is revealed.

In the selfish approach, each peer would like to exploit the full capacity of his access link only for his downloads. However, if all peers acted selfishly, the system would collapse. In order to motivate peers to cooperate, we propose a distributed reputation-based system according to which peers earn reputation analogous to their contributions. In this way, each peer has to trade off the capacity he will dedicate for uploading in order to increase his reputation and therefore his revenue and the capacity he will dedicate for his downloads. All peers act rationally, trying to maximize their utility. Our proposed policies lead rational peers to cooperation while promoting fairness, as peers receive resources in proportion to their contributions. Our policies outperform existing work in this area in which the slowest link becomes the bottleneck of a heterogeneous system of different link capacity peers. On the contrary, no such bottleneck appears when our policies are used, improving the performance of the system. Finally, we apply our reputation-based approach in a BitTorrent-like file sharing system and we highlight the potential performance gains."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.80"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967576"",""Cooperation enforcement";distributed resource allocation;P2P systems;"reputation."",""Resource management";Peer to peer computing;Game theory;Spine;Performance gain;Collaborative work;Control systems;Wireless application protocol;"Access protocols"","""",""62"","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""26 May 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Besides internode heterogeneity, many of these systems also show a high degree of intranode dynamism, so that selecting nodes based only on their recently observed resource capacities can lead to poor deployment decisions resulting in application failures or migration overheads. However, most existing resource discovery mechanisms rely mainly on recent observations to achieve scalability in large systems. In this paper, we propose the notion of a resource bundle-a representative resource usage distribution for a group of nodes with similar resource usage patterns-that employs two complementary techniques to overcome the limitations of existing techniques: resource usage histograms to provide statistical guarantees for resource capacities and clustering-based resource aggregation to achieve scalability. Using trace-driven simulations and data analysis of a month-long PlanetLab trace, we show that resource bundles are able to provide high accuracy for statistical resource discovery, while achieving high scalability. We also show that resource bundles are ideally suited for identifying group-level characteristics (e.g., hot spots, total group capacity). To automatically parameterize the bundling algorithm, we present an adaptive algorithm that can detect online fluctuations in resource heterogeneity."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.143"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226621"",""Resource discovery";aggregation;resource management;"machine learning."",""Large-scale systems";Resource management;Scalability;Histograms;Fluctuations;Availability;Analytical models;Data analysis;Machine learning algorithms;"Adaptive algorithm"","""",""10"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""28 Aug 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;

We study two distinct cases of interest, static case and dynamic case, and propose two novel strategies, referred to as static scheduling strategy (SSS) and dynamic scheduling strategy (DSS), respectively.

For reasons of (universal) implementability, the MPI standard does not state any specific performance guarantees, but users expect MPI implementations to deliver good and consistent performance in the sense of efficient utilization of the underlying parallel (communication) system. For performance portability reasons, users also naturally desire communication optimizations performed on one parallel platform with one MPI implementation to be preserved when switching to another MPI implementation on another platform. We address the problem of ensuring performance consistency and portability by formulating performance guidelines and conditions that are desirable for good MPI implementations to fulfill. Instead of prescribing a specific performance model (which may be realistic on some systems, under some MPI protocol and algorithm assumptions, etc.), we formulate these guidelines by relating the performance of various aspects of the semantically strongly interrelated MPI standard to each other. Common-sense expectations, for instance, suggest that no MPI function should perform worse than a combination of other MPI functions that implement the same functionality, no specialized function should perform worse than a more general function that can implement the same functionality, no function with weak semantic guarantees should perform worse than a similar function with stronger semantics, and so on. Such guidelines may enable implementers to provide higher quality MPI implementations, minimize performance surprises, and eliminate the need for users to make special, nonportable optimizations by hand. We introduce and semiformalize the concept of self-consistent performance guidelines for MPI, and provide a (nonexhaustive) set of such guidelines in a form that could be automatically verified by benchmarks and experiment management tools. We present experimental results that show cases where guidelines are not satisfied in common MPI implementations, thereby indicating room for improvement in today's MPI implementations."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2009.120"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5184825"",""Parallel processing";message passing;message-passing interface;MPI;performance portability;performance prediction;performance model;public benchmarking;"performance guidelines."",""Guidelines";Parallel programming;Hardware;Libraries;Computer Society;Application software;Communication standards;Communication switching;Protocols;"Message passing"","""",""22"","""",""41"",""IEEE"",""31 Jul 2009"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;

Some newly developed worms (e.g., “Atak” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms.

This analysis results in the creation of a method commutativity specification (MCS), which is used by a distributed caching system to ensure the consistency of method invocations. For greater commutativity, weaker consistency requirements can be specified in the MCS.

In the most general setting, the problems we study are NP-hard even to approximate, and so we focus on heuristic algorithms that perform well in practice. In the static setting, we propose a greedy centralized solution and a more sophisticated solution that uses the Generalized Assignment Problem model and can be implemented in a distributed fashion. In what we call the dynamic setting, missions arrive over time and have different durations. For this setting, we give heuristic algorithms in which available sensors propose to nearby missions as they arrive. We find that the overall performance can be significantly improved if available sensors sometimes refuse to offer utility to missions they could help, making this decision based on the value of the mission, the sensor's remaining energy, and (if known) the remaining target lifetime of the network.

In this paper, we propose SocioNet, a social-based overlay that clusters peers based on their preference relationships as a small-world network. In SocioNet, peers mimic how people form a social network and how they query, by preference, their friends or acquaintances. Hence, SocioNet benefits from two desirable features of a social network: interest-based clustering and small-world properties (i.e., high cluster coefficient among all peers yet short path lengths between any two peers). To realize an interest-based small-world SocioNet, we also investigate the following practical design issues: 1) similarity estimation: we define a quantifiable similarity measure that enables clustering of similar peers in SocioNet"; 2) distributed small-world overlay adaptation: peers maintain a small-world overlay under network dynamics;" and 3) query strategy under the small-world overlay: we analyze appropriate settings for the Time-to-Live (TTL) value, for TTL-limited flooding, that provides a satisfactory success ratio and avoids redundant message overhead. We use simulations and a real database called AudioScrobbler [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], which tracks users' listening habits, to evaluate the performance of SocioNet.

A relaying node starts distributing a chunk only when it has completed its reception from another node. Peers are logically organized in a forest of trees, where each tree includes all peers. The source periodically distributes different chunks to each tree for their delivery. Our key idea consists in employing serial transmission: for each tree, and thus, for each chunk, the source node sends the chunk to its children in series; the same holds for each peer node of the tree, excluding the leaves. Besides this basic idea, the contributions of this paper are: 1) we demonstrate the feasibility of serial transmission over a forest of trees, which is not a trivial problem, unlike the case of parallel transmission; 2) we derive an analytical model to evaluate the system performance; 3) we derive a theoretical bound for the number of nodes reachable in a given time interval or equivalently for the time required to reach a given number of nodes; 4) we prove the optimality of our approach in terms of its capability to reach such bound;" and 5) we develop a general simulation package for P2P streaming systems and use it to compare our solution to literature results.

In contrast, in this work, we introduce a payment formula to ensure the existence of a Strongly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium (SDSE), a different solution concept that gives participants much stronger incentives. We show that, when the system converges to an SDSE, it also achieves global optimality in terms of system throughput. Furthermore, we extend our work to the case in which some radios have a limited tunability. We show that in such a case, nevertheless, it is generally impossible to have a similar SDSE solution";" with additional assumptions on the numbers of radios and the types of channels, etc., we can again achieve an SDSE solution that guarantees optimal system throughput. Besides this extension, we also consider other extensions of our strategic game to achieve throughput fairness and to deal with possibly inconsistent information caused by players joining and leaving. Finally, we evaluate our design with simulated experiments.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the synchronization power of these new memory access mechanisms. This paper investigates the synchronization power of coalesced memory accesses, a family of memory access mechanisms introduced in recent large multicore architectures such as the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).

However, a major challenge in 3D technology is the increased power density, which gives rise to the concern of heat dissipation within the processor. High temperatures trigger voltage and frequency throttlings in hardware, which degrade the chip performance. Moreover, high temperatures impair the processor's reliability and reduce its lifetime. To alleviate this problem, we propose in this paper an OS-level scheduling algorithm that performs thermal-aware task scheduling on a 3D chip. Our algorithm leverages the inherent thermal variations within and across different tasks, and schedules them to keep the chip temperature low. We observed that vertically adjacent dies have strong thermal correlations and the scheduler should consider them jointly.

We prove that using k-CAS primitives can improve neither the time nor the space complexity of implementations of widely used concurrent objects, such as counter, stack, queue, and collect. Surprisingly, overly restrictive use of k-CAS may even increase the space complexity required by such implementations. We prove a lower bound of \Omega (\log_2 n) on the round complexity of implementations of a collect object using read, write, and k-CAS, for any k, where n is the number of processes in the system. There is an implementation of collect with O(\log_2 n) round complexity that uses only reads and writes. Thus, our lower bound establishes that k-CAS is no stronger than read and write for collect implementation round complexity. For k-CAS operations that return the values of all the objects they access, we prove that the total step complexity of implementing key objects such as counters, stacks, and queues is \Omega (n \log_k n). We also prove that k-CAS cannot improve the space complexity of implementing many objects (including counter, stack, queue, and single-writer snapshot).

In our work, we study the problem of traffic management in the context of sensor networks with a mobile sink. Under sink mobility, various new challenges arise that need to be effectively addressed. Adaptation to sink mobility requires agile as well as effective load estimation techniques. In addition, unlike static networks, path reliability often fluctuates due to path reconfigurations. Thus, injecting traffic during transient periods of poor path quality might wastefully detain network resources. In this work, we first study the effect of sink mobility on traffic load in sensor networks. We then propose adaptive routing as well as load estimation techniques that effectively adapt to sink relocations. A novel aspect of our approach is that it jointly considers the network load as well as path quality variations to facilitate intelligent, mobility-adaptive rate regulation at the sources.

In this paper, we present an approach to the accurate and efficient representation and querying of multiattribute items using Bloom filters. The approach proposes three variant structures of Bloom filters: parallel Bloom filter (referred as PBF) structure, PBF with a hash table (PBF-HT), and PBF with a Bloom filter (PBF-BF). PBF stores multiple attributes of an item in parallel Bloom filters. The auxiliary HT and BF provide functions to capture the inherent dependency of all attributes of an item. Compared to standard Bloom filters to represent items with multiple attributes, the proposed PBF facilitates much faster query service and both PBF-HT and PBF-BF structures achieve much lower false positive probability with a result to save storage space.

In this paper, we propose an exact analytical solution for performance evaluation of dynamic policies used for routing of TUF-constrained Firm Real-Time (FRT) jobs among parallel single-processor queues with arbitrary processing rates and capacities. The analytical method can be used for the evaluation of the compliance of some important statistical assurance requirements. Furthermore, we present a utility-aware dynamic routing policy to improve the expected accrued utility of the parallel system. The policy called Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) behaves based on the information gathered from the analytical solution. MEU is compared with some well-known Dynamic Routing (DR) policies for different TUF shapes and both cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous processors of a two-queue system. The comparisons show the efficiency of MEU for the former case and its good behavior in most situations for the latter case."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.50"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440172"",""Analytical modeling";firm real-time systems;performance modeling;time/utility function;"utility accrual dynamic routing."",""Routing";Real time systems;Ad hoc networks;Time factors;Performance analysis;Streaming media;Quality of service;Timing;Queueing analysis;"Utility theory"","""",""8"","""",""40"",""IEEE"",""29 Mar 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;

Our design uniquely leverages upon the facts that 1) the movement of targets (e.g., vehicles) is confined within roadways and 2) the road network maps are normally known. We guarantee the detection of moving targets before they reach designated protection points (such as temporary base camps), while maximizing the lifetime of the sensor network. The main idea of this work is virtual scan-waves of sensing activities scheduled for road network protection. We provide design-space analysis on the performance of virtual scan in terms of lifetime and average detection delay. Importantly, to our knowledge, this is the first work to study how to guarantee target detection while sensor network deteriorates, using a novel hole handling technique. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is shown that a surveillance system, using our design, sustains orders-of-magnitude longer lifetime than full coverage algorithms, and as much as 10 times longer than legacy duty cycling algorithms."",""1558-2183"","""",""10.1109/TPDS.2010.60"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445080"",""Sensor network";road network;virtual scanning;surveillance;detection;"protection."",""Surveillance";Protection;Wireless sensor networks;Road vehicles;Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Delay;"Object detection"","""",""6"","""",""31"",""IEEE"",""8 Apr 2010"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;
